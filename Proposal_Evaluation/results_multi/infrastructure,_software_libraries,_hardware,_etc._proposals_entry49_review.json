    "Summary": "The proposal aims to optimize distributed training infrastructure for large-scale AI models through a hardware-software co-design approach, addressing communication overhead, memory management, and hardware utilization. It proposes three main components: topology-aware communication scheduling, memory-centric runtime, and kernel fusion for hardware acceleration.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and relevant problem statement.",
        "Strong motivation and hypothesis building on prior work.",
        "Detailed and comprehensive proposed method.",
        "Thorough experiment plan with clear benchmarks and metrics."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks detailed discussion of potential technical challenges and risks.",
        "Feasibility of proposed solutions is somewhat assumed rather than rigorously justified.",
        "Experiment plan could benefit from more explicit discussion of ablation studies and failure modes."
