    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a hybrid optimization framework combining zeroth-order (ZO) and evolutionary strategies (ES) to address limitations in gradient-based and gradient-free methods. It aims to achieve adaptive exploration-exploitation trade-offs in non-convex, noisy, or discontinuous optimization landscapes. The method includes adaptive switching, gradient-aware mutation, and memory-efficient ZO, with experiments planned on synthetic benchmarks, adversarial robustness, hyperparameter optimization, and reinforcement learning.",
