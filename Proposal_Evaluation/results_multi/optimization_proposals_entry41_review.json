    "Summary": "The proposal introduces AdaReg, a novel optimizer combining noise-adaptive gradient scaling, curvature-aware momentum, and dynamic clipping thresholds to unify adaptivity and stability in gradient-based optimization. It targets limitations in existing methods like Adam and SGD, with experiments planned across synthetic benchmarks, deep learning tasks, and challenging landscapes.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement with well-articulated limitations of existing methods.",
        "Hypothesis is grounded in recent literature and theoretically sound.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan covering diverse tasks and ablation studies.",
        "Innovative integration of noise-adaptive scaling and curvature-aware momentum."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks detailed discussion on computational overhead and scalability.",
        "Theoretical analysis is mentioned but not elaborated.",
        "Potential risks with Hessian approximations in very large models are not addressed."
