Weaknesses: Lacks detailed discussion on computational feasibility and scalability of low-rank Hessian approximations for large models., Insufficient exploration of potential pitfalls, such as the accuracy of Hessian approximations in high-dimensional spaces., Experimental plan could benefit from more emphasis on real-world applicability and scalability., Theoretical analysis, while mentioned, is not detailed in the proposal.
