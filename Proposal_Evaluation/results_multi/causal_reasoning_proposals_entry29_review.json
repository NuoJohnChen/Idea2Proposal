    "Summary": "The proposal introduces Dynamic Structural Causal Models (DSCMs) to enhance causal reasoning in AI by integrating time-varying causal structures with neural representation learning. It targets applications in healthcare, reinforcement learning, and high-dimensional data, aiming to bridge the gap between correlation-based deep learning and principled causal reasoning.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement.",
        "Strong motivation with relevant examples from healthcare and reinforcement learning.",
        "Innovative integration of dynamic causal graph learning, counterfactual reasoning, and scalable inference.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan covering multiple domains and validation metrics."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks detailed discussion on potential technical challenges (e.g., computational complexity, robustness of causal attention).",
        "Validation plan could benefit from more explicit discussion of ablation studies and potential failure modes.",
        "Limited discussion on how to handle unobserved confounders in dynamic settings."
