    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a hybrid optimization method combining zeroth- and first-order techniques for non-smooth objectives, with dynamic switching based on gradient reliability. Applications include adversarial robustness and reinforcement learning. The method involves gradient reliability estimation, hybrid update rule design, and scalable implementation. The experiment plan covers validation, benchmarking, scaling tests, theoretical analysis, and real-world deployment.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement identifying gaps in current optimization methods.",
        "Plausible hypothesis with potential for impact in non-smooth optimization.",
