    "Summary": "The proposal aims to bridge the gap between correlation and causation in deep learning by developing a hybrid framework that combines deep neural networks with causal reasoning primitives. It focuses on causal representation learning, intervention-aware architectures, and scalable causal discovery, with a comprehensive experiment plan covering synthetic and real-world datasets, language-based reasoning, scalability, and human-AI collaboration.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Addresses a significant and timely problem in deep learning.",
        "Well-articulated problem statement and motivation grounded in recent literature.",
        "Ambitious and plausible hypothesis combining deep learning with causal reasoning.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan covering multiple aspects of causal reasoning."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks detailed technical specifics on key components like causal attention mechanism and differentiable causal discovery.",
        "Feasibility concerns due to the ambitious scope and lack of implementation details.",
        "Evaluation plan could benefit from more explicit discussion of potential pitfalls and alternative outcomes."
