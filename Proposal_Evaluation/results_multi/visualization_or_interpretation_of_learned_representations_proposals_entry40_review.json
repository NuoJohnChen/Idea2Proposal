    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a framework for interpreting and disentangling learned features in deep neural networks (DNNs) by combining hierarchical feature visualization, causal interpretability scoring, and geometry-constrained disentanglement. It hypothesizes that features are encoded in a compositionally sparse manner and proposes methods to identify feature subspaces, measure their causal influence, and enforce disentanglement through latent space geometry constraints. The experiment plan includes benchmarking, validation on synthetic and real data, scaling to language models, and deployment for model debugging.",
