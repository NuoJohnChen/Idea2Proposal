    "Summary": "The proposal aims to extend deep learning to non-Euclidean domains by incorporating geometric and topological priors into neural architectures. It addresses limitations of existing GNNs through equivariant layers, topological enhancements, and scalable training paradigms, with a detailed experiment plan for validation.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement.",
        "High novelty and ambition in addressing non-Euclidean domains.",
        "Comprehensive proposed method with multiple innovative components.",
        "Detailed experiment plan including validation, benchmarking, and ablation studies."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks discussion of potential technical challenges and risks.",
        "Execution plan could be more grounded with explicit solutions to anticipated problems.",
        "Baseline comparisons and potential failure modes are not thoroughly discussed."
