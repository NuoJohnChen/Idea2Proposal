    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a unified framework for scalable and robust probabilistic inference by combining Bayesian methods with deep learning. It addresses limitations in variational inference, MCMC, and uncertainty quantification, proposing adaptive variational families, parallel SG-MCMC, and robust UQ metrics. The experiment plan includes benchmarking, scalability evaluation, OOD testing, and integration with deep learning architectures.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement identifying key limitations of current methods.",
        "Ambitious and well-structured hypothesis focusing on adaptive variational families, parallel SG-MCMC, and robust UQ.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan covering benchmarking, scalability, OOD testing, and integration with deep learning."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Vague technical details (e.g., 'novel preconditioning scheme').",
        "Lacks depth in specifying baselines for comparison.",
        "Limited discussion on potential risks and mitigation strategies."
