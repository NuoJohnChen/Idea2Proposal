Weaknesses: Lacks depth in addressing potential technical challenges (e.g., computational complexity)., Feasibility of real-time human-in-the-loop calibration is not thoroughly explored., Validation plan could benefit from more explicit discussion of baseline comparisons and failure modes., Real-world deployment tests may face significant logistical and ethical challenges.
