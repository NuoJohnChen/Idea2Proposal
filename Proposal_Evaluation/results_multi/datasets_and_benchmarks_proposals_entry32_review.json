    "Summary": "The proposal aims to address biases and evaluation gaps in machine learning benchmarks by introducing dynamic, compositional, and auditable benchmarks. It proposes a three-pronged approach: dynamic benchmarking framework, compositional task design, and data provenance tracking. The experiment plan includes meta-analysis of existing benchmarks, development of dynamic evaluation prototypes, testing compositional generalization, auditing real-world transfer, and quantifying scalability vs. robustness tradeoffs.",
