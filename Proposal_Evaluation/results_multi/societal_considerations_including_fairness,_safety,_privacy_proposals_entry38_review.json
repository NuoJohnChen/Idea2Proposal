    "Summary": "The proposal presents a multidisciplinary framework to co-optimize fairness, safety, and privacy in AI systems. It hypothesizes that these objectives are intrinsically linked and proposes a dynamic, context-aware approach using multi-objective optimization and human-in-the-loop audits. The method includes unified risk modeling, context-aware adaptation, and audit mechanisms, with a detailed experiment plan spanning benchmark studies, validation, and longitudinal impact assessment.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Addresses a critical and timely issue in AI systems.",
        "Comprehensive problem statement highlighting limitations of current approaches.",
        "Detailed and well-structured experiment plan.",
        "Includes a longitudinal societal impact study, adding real-world relevance.",
        "Ambitious and well-articulated hypothesis.",
        "Strong motivation supported by prior work."

    "Weaknesses": [
        "Feasibility of integrating all components into a cohesive framework is unclear.",
        "Lacks detailed discussion on potential technical challenges and mitigation strategies.",
