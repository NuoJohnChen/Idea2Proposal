    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a hybrid probabilistic inference framework combining variational inference (VI) and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to address scalability and robustness challenges in deep learning. It proposes dynamic switching between VI and MCMC, structured approximations for scalability, and adaptive uncertainty quantification (UQ) techniques.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement highlighting limitations of current probabilistic methods in deep learning.",
        "Innovative idea of combining VI and MCMC to leverage their respective strengths.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan covering synthetic benchmarks, high-dimensional models, and real-world tasks."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks detailed technical specifics on the dynamic switching mechanism and structured approximations.",
        "Experiment plan could benefit from more detailed baselines and validation metrics.",
        "Limited discussion on potential challenges and risks in implementing the proposed framework."
