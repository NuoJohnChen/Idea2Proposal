Overall Quality: 7
Argumentative Cohesion: 7
Intellectual Depth: 6
Execution Credibility: 6
Scientific Rigor: 6
Decision: Reject
Weaknesses: Limited novelty in dynamic architecture modulation, which resembles existing mixture-of-experts approaches., Lack of technical details on the robustness-aware optimization regularizer., Experiment plan does not clearly link results to the core hypothesis., Feasibility of combining these techniques is overly optimistic without addressing technical hurdles.
