Weaknesses: Feasibility concerns regarding the interactive probing component, particularly the recruitment of domain experts and scalability of human-in-the-loop tools., Lack of detailed discussion on potential technical challenges and mitigation strategies., Validation plan could benefit from more explicit discussion of ablation studies and potential failure modes., Potential biases in human annotations during interactive probing could affect the interpretability results.
