Overall Quality: 6
Argumentative Cohesion: 7
Intellectual Depth: 7
Execution Credibility: 5
Scientific Rigor: 6
Decision: Reject
Weaknesses: Lacks detailed discussion on technical challenges (e.g., computational overhead, stability of meta-learning)., Execution plan feels optimistic given the complexity of the proposed integration., Validation plan could benefit from more stress tests on edge cases (e.g., extreme label scarcity, noisy labels)., Theoretical grounding for the unified framework is not fully fleshed out.
