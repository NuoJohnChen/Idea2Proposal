    "Summary": "The proposal introduces Curvature-Aware Adaptive Momentum (CAAM), a novel optimizer that integrates local curvature awareness into adaptive gradient methods using low-rank Hessian approximations. It aims to address the limitations of current methods in non-convex landscapes by combining first-order momentum with second-order Hessian-guided updates.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and compelling problem statement highlighting limitations of current adaptive optimization methods.",
        "Innovative hypothesis integrating second-order information for better optimization performance.",
        "Comprehensive experimental plan including synthetic benchmarks, deep learning tasks, and scalability tests.",
        "Potential for significant impact in optimization for non-convex problems."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks detailed discussion on computational feasibility and scalability of low-rank Hessian approximations for large models.",
        "Insufficient exploration of potential pitfalls, such as the accuracy of Hessian approximations in high-dimensional spaces.",
        "Experimental plan could benefit from more emphasis on real-world applicability and scalability.",
        "Theoretical analysis, while mentioned, is not detailed in the proposal."
