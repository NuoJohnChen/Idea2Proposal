    "Summary": "The proposal aims to unify transfer, meta, and lifelong learning through a hierarchical memory system with dynamic representation composition. It combines meta-learned initialization, lifelong memory updates, and task-conditioned routing to achieve both rapid adaptation and long-term knowledge retention.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement highlighting limitations of existing approaches.",
        "Innovative hypothesis of dynamic representation composition and hierarchical memory architecture.",
        "Thorough experimental plan with multiple benchmarks and ablation studies.",
        "Strong grounding in prior work, with references to key papers in the field."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks detailed discussion on computational overhead and scalability of the proposed dual-memory system.",
        "Task routing mechanism could benefit from more technical details and potential challenges.",
        "Experimental plan could include more discussion on potential failure modes and limitations of the proposed method."

        "What are the potential failure modes of the task routing mechanism, and how will they be mitigated?",
        "How will the method ensure that the meta-learned initialization does not bias the lifelong updates?"

    "Limitations": [
        "Potential computational overhead due to the dual-memory system.",
        "Scalability of the task routing mechanism for very large task distributions.",
        "Risk of meta-learned initialization biasing the lifelong updates."
