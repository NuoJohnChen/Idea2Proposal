    "Summary": "The proposal introduces adaptive latent dynamics to improve generative models (diffusion models, GANs, VAEs) by dynamically adjusting noise schedules, discriminator feedback, and latent transitions. The goal is to bridge the quality-diversity gap while maintaining efficiency and stability.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement highlighting trade-offs in generative models.",
        "Innovative hypothesis proposing adaptive latent dynamics as a unifying solution.",
        "Ambitious scope targeting three major model families with specific adaptive mechanisms.",
        "Detailed experiment plan covering benchmarks, ablations, and human evaluations."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Feasibility concerns due to the broad scope (three model families).",
        "Lacks detailed discussion of computational overhead and training stability risks.",
        "Validation plan does not clearly test the universality of adaptive dynamics across models.",
        "Limited exploration of potential failure modes or limitations of adaptive mechanisms."

    "Questions": [
        "How will the computational overhead of adaptive mechanisms be managed, especially for high-resolution datasets?",
        "What are the potential failure modes of adaptive dynamics, and how will they be mitigated?",
        "How will the universality of adaptive dynamics be tested across different data modalities (e.g., images vs. sequential data)?"

    "Limitations": [
        "Potential increased computational cost due to adaptive mechanisms.",
        "Risk of training instability from dynamic feedback in GANs.",
        "Unclear scalability to very high-dimensional data (e.g., 1024x1024 images)."
