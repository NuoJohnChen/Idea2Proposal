Weaknesses: Lacks depth in discussing potential technical challenges and risks, particularly in hardware-software co-design., Validation plan could benefit from more critical analyses, such as ablation studies., Limited discussion on the scalability of the proposed solutions beyond the 256-GPU cluster., High dependency on emerging hardware (e.g., CXL) introduces significant technical uncertainty.
