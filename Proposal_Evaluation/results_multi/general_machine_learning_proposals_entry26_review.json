    "Summary": "The proposal aims to enhance machine learning robustness by integrating causal invariance principles with distributionally robust optimization (DRO). It proposes a three-pronged approach: causal feature learning via environment partitioning, scalable DRO, and uncertainty-aware model calibration. The experiment plan includes synthetic benchmarking, real-world validation, large-scale training, downstream task evaluation, and theoretical analysis.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Addresses a critical and timely issue in machine learning.",
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement with relevant literature citations.",
        "Strong motivation and hypothesis integrating causal invariance and DRO.",
        "Ambitious and comprehensive proposed method.",
