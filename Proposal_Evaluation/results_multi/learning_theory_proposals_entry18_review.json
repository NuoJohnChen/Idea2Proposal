    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a theoretical framework for adaptive learning dynamics in non-convex optimization, combining curvature-aware updates, trajectory memory, and saddle-point escape guarantees. It targets improved convergence, generalization, and saddle-point escape in deep learning.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-motivated problem statement.",
        "Ambitious and innovative hypothesis combining second-order information and memory-driven adaptation.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan covering synthetic benchmarks, deep learning ablations, generalization analysis, and large-scale scaling.",
        "Strong theoretical grounding with references to recent advances in optimization and randomized linear algebra."

    "Weaknesses": [
        "Feasibility of integrating all components into a cohesive framework is uncertain.",
        "Lack of detailed discussion on potential technical challenges and alternative approaches.",
        "Computational overhead of curvature-aware updates and memory mechanism in large-scale settings is not fully addressed.",
