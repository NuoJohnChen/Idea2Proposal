    "Summary": "The proposal aims to bridge computational models of cognitive control with neurobiological evidence by developing a spiking neural network (SNN) model that integrates PFC, subcortical regions, and neuromodulators. The model will be validated against human and non-human primate datasets and tested for clinical relevance and translational applications.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Addresses a significant gap in the field by unifying computational models with neurobiological mechanisms.",
        "Well-motivated hypothesis based on prior work and recent evidence.",
        "Technically sophisticated method using SNNs and biologically plausible learning rules.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan covering multiple validation steps and translational applications."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks detailed discussion on potential technical challenges.",
        "Validation plan may be overly ambitious given the model's complexity.",
        "Limited discussion on handling variability in neural data across species and individuals.",
        "No clear address on how the model will be scaled or optimized for computational feasibility."
