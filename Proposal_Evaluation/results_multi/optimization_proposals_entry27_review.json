    "Summary": "The proposal aims to bridge the gap between theoretical guarantees and practical performance in non-convex optimization by developing geometry-aware algorithms, theoretical frameworks, and hardware-efficient implementations. It targets optimizers that are both theoretically sound and practically efficient.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Compelling problem statement highlighting a critical gap in optimization theory and practice.",
        "High intellectual depth with a focus on structured non-convexity and geometry-aware design.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan covering synthetic benchmarks, deep learning ablations, and large-scale scaling."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks detailed technical specifics on how the proposed methods will overcome non-convex challenges.",
        "Experiment plan is somewhat generic, lacking depth in rigorous testing against state-of-the-art baselines.",
        "Limited discussion on potential pitfalls and technical risks."
