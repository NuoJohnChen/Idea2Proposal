    "Summary": "The proposal aims to address biases and evaluation gaps in machine learning benchmarks by introducing a systematic redesign focusing on controlled diversity, dynamic updates, and stress-testing. The method includes bias-aware dataset curation, dynamic evaluation protocols, and multidimensional metrics. The experiment plan involves auditing existing benchmarks, building controlled diversity datasets, testing dynamic evaluation, stress-testing robustness, and benchmarking scalability.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement with relevant literature citations.",
        "Strong motivation and hypothesis that systematic redesign can mitigate benchmark issues.",
        "Comprehensive proposed method covering multiple aspects of benchmark innovation.",
        "Detailed and logically structured experiment plan."

    "Weaknesses": [
        "Limited technical details on how dynamic evaluation protocols will handle real-time adversarial example generation and model-in-the-loop data collection.",
        "Unclear how bias-aware curation will scale to large datasets without introducing new biases.",
        "No concrete plan for ensuring the proposed benchmarks gain traction in the research community.",
        "Validation plan lacks detailed ablation studies to isolate the impact of individual components."
