    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a theoretical framework for adaptive learning dynamics in non-convex optimization, unifying analyses of methods like SGD and Adam. It hypothesizes that locally adaptive learning dynamics can outperform static methods and proposes to formalize this via stochastic differential equations (SDEs), derive conditions for avoiding poor minima, and design principled optimizers. The experiment plan includes synthetic landscapes, deep network loss surfaces, and real-world benchmarks.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Novel and intellectually deep hypothesis proposing a dynamical systems perspective.",

        "Thorough experiment plan covering synthetic and real-world scenarios.",
        "Strong alignment between theoretical analysis and empirical validation."

    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks detailed discussion on potential technical challenges and risks.",
        "Could benefit from more concrete examples of the proposed adaptive optimizers.",
