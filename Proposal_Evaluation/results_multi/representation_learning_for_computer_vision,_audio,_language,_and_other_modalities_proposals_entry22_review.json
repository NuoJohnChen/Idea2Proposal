    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a unified framework for multimodal representation learning across vision, audio, language, and other modalities. It hypothesizes that a shared latent space with modality-agnostic encoders and contrastive learning can enable robust cross-modal transfer, even with limited paired data. The method includes modality-agnostic encoders, cross-modal alignment via contrastive learning, and zero-shot modality transfer via modality dropout. The experiment plan is comprehensive, covering validation on established benchmarks, scaling to diverse modalities, zero-shot generalization, efficiency, and ablation studies.",
