    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a biologically plausible, energy-efficient model of dynamic attention by integrating spiking neural networks with dynamic gating mechanisms. It seeks to validate the model using synthetic tasks, neural data, behavioral correlations, and disorder-specific ablations, with the goal of bridging computational models and cognitive neuroscience.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement highlighting gaps in current models.",
        "Comprehensive and detailed experiment plan.",
        "Integration of diverse datasets (neural, behavioral, clinical).",
        "Ambitious goal of bridging computational and cognitive neuroscience."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks detailed discussion of technical challenges (e.g., training SNNs, computational costs).",
        "Validation plan could be more explicit about baseline comparisons and ablation studies.",
        "Reliance on existing gating mechanisms may limit novelty.",
        "Potential over-optimism in scaling to whole-brain fMRI data."
