    "Summary": "The proposal aims to enhance the interpretability of deep neural networks by combining geometric disentanglement, concept bottleneck models, and quantitative metrics. It addresses limitations in current methods, such as scalability and disentanglement, and proposes experiments to validate the approach across various architectures and real-world applications.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement with well-articulated motivation.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan with multiple validation steps.",
        "Integration of human-in-the-loop validation for semantic alignment.",
        "Grounds proposed methods in existing literature."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks significant novelty in proposed methods; relies heavily on existing techniques.",
        "Feasibility of scaling to large models is not thoroughly addressed.",
        "Validation plan could be more critical, especially in addressing biases in human studies.",
        "Experiment plan is somewhat generic and lacks critical stress tests."
