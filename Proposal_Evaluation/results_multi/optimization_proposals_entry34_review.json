    "Summary": "The proposal introduces dynamic regularization for gradient-based optimization methods, aiming to improve adaptability and performance by adjusting weight decay and gradient clipping thresholds based on real-time gradient statistics. The method involves a lightweight auxiliary network for monitoring gradient distributions and efficient curvature estimation. The experiment plan is comprehensive, covering synthetic benchmarking, computer vision ablations, language model scaling, reinforcement learning stress tests, and theoretical analysis.",
