    "Summary": "The proposal introduces Meta-Continual Transfer (MCT), a unified framework combining transfer learning, meta-learning, and lifelong learning to address continual and generalizable learning. It hypothesizes that integrating memory-augmented meta-learning with gradient-based transfer can synergize rapid adaptation, knowledge preservation, and efficient reuse. The method includes meta-initialization with task memory, gradient-based forgetting mitigation, and attention-driven transfer. The experiment plan covers synthetic tasks, cross-domain transfer, scalability, ablation studies, and real-world deployment.",
