    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a unified framework for ensuring fairness, safety, and privacy in AI systems through adaptive fairness auditing, formal safety verification, and privacy-utility tradeoff optimization. It targets high-stakes domains like hiring, healthcare, and criminal justice, addressing gaps in current approaches. The experimental plan includes auditing real-world systems, testing safety interventions, optimizing privacy-fairness tradeoffs, longitudinal stakeholder evaluation, and benchmarking against baselines.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Timely and critical problem statement",
        "Strong motivation with relevant literature citations",
        "Ambitious and intellectually deep proposed method",
        "Comprehensive experimental plan with stakeholder evaluation",
        "Plans for benchmarking against state-of-the-art methods"
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lack of specificity in some execution details (e.g., symbolic reasoning tools with LLMs)",
        "Feasibility concerns with deploying prototypes with nonprofits",
        "Limited discussion on risk mitigation strategies",
        "Overly ambitious scope, particularly in longitudinal stakeholder evaluation and deployment"

        "What specific strategies will be used to ensure meaningful participation from impacted communities?",
        "How will the framework handle cases where fairness, safety, and privacy objectives conflict?",
        "What are the contingency plans if stakeholder collaboration (e.g., with nonprofits) falls through?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "Potential challenges in integrating symbolic reasoning tools with LLMs",
        "Feasibility of deploying prototypes in real-world settings",
        "Risk of stakeholder feedback being biased or unrepresentative",
