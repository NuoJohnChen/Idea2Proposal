    "Summary": "The proposal introduces an adaptive gating mechanism for model-based priors in reinforcement learning to improve sample efficiency. It combines uncertainty-aware gating, hierarchical priors, and stabilized hybrid learning, with a comprehensive experiment plan covering toy environments, benchmarking, sparse-robot manipulation, generalization, and real-world validation.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement highlighting the limitations of current RL methods.",
        "Strong motivation with a well-defined hypothesis.",
        "Detailed proposed method with three key components.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan covering multiple validation steps."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lack of detailed discussion on training the gating network and computing uncertainty estimates.",
        "Potential complexity in implementing hierarchical priors.",
        "Overly optimistic real-world validation step without detailed risk analysis.",
        "Limited discussion on mitigating technical challenges."
