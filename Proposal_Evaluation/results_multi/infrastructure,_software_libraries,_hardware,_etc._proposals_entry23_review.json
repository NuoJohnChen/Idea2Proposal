    "Summary": "The proposal aims to optimize distributed training infrastructure for large-scale AI models through a hardware-software co-design approach, targeting inefficient communication patterns, suboptimal memory hierarchy utilization, and lack of fault tolerance mechanisms. The methodology includes a topology-aware communication library, memory-centric kernel optimization, and a failure-resilient training protocol.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement with well-articulated bottlenecks.",
        "Comprehensive experimental plan covering multiple aspects of distributed training.",
        "Relevant and timely topic given the rapid growth of large-scale AI models."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lack of detailed technical analysis to substantiate the ambitious performance claims.",
        "Feasibility of implementing the proposed solutions is not thoroughly discussed.",
        "Experimental plan is somewhat generic and lacks specific success metrics.",
        "Limited discussion on potential technical challenges and risks."

    "Questions": [
        "What preliminary evidence supports the hypothesis of achieving >40% faster training throughput and >30% lower energy consumption?",
        "How will the proposed JIT compiler handle the diversity of memory-bound operations across different model architectures?",
        "What are the specific technical challenges in implementing the topology-aware communication library, and how will they be addressed?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "The proposal does not address the scalability of the proposed solutions beyond the 1024-GPU setup.",
        "The impact of gradient compression on model convergence is not thoroughly analyzed.",
        "The proposal assumes that the hardware capabilities (e.g., NVLink 4.0, CXL 3.0) will be fully exploitable, which may not be the case in practice."
