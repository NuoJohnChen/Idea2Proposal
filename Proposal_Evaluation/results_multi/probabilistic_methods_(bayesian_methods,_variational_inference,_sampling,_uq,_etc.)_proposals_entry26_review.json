    "Summary": "The proposal seeks to develop a hybrid framework combining normalizing flows, adaptive MCMC, and deep learning to address scalability and robustness issues in probabilistic inference. It aims to enrich variational families, improve MCMC efficiency, and integrate rigorous UQ into deep learning.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement identifying key limitations in current probabilistic methods.",
        "Ambitious hypothesis proposing a novel hybrid framework.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan covering benchmarking, evaluation, integration, and ablation studies."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks detailed technical specifics in the proposed method, particularly in flow architectures and MCMC adaptations.",
        "Experiment plan is somewhat generic, missing concrete implementation details and risk mitigation strategies.",
        "Limited discussion on potential challenges and how they will be addressed."
