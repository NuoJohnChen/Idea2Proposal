    "Summary": "The proposal aims to improve the efficiency of distributed training for large-scale AI models by co-designing hardware-aware software libraries and adaptive parallelism strategies. It targets communication overhead, memory fragmentation, and fault recovery through a three-part approach: communication-optimized runtime, memory-efficient training stack, and fault tolerance via incremental snapshots. The experiment plan includes benchmarking, evaluation, and ablation studies to validate the proposed solutions.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement.",
        "Comprehensive proposed method targeting key bottlenecks.",
        "Detailed experiment plan with benchmarking, evaluation, and ablation studies.",
        "Strong grounding in existing literature."

    "Weaknesses": [
        "Novelty is incremental, building on existing work without groundbreaking insights.",
        "Insufficient discussion of potential technical risks and scalability concerns.",
        "Feasibility concerns regarding the integration of newer GPU features."
