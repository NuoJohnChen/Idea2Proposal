    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a new framework for machine learning benchmark design, focusing on dynamic benchmarking, bias-aware design, and multi-dimensional evaluation to address current limitations in model assessment. It includes a detailed experiment plan from auditing existing benchmarks to scaling and disseminating new tools.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement highlighting critical issues in current benchmarks.",
        "Strong motivation and hypothesis, with a focus on dynamic benchmarking, bias-aware design, and multi-dimensional evaluation.",
        "Comprehensive proposed method covering bias mitigation, dynamic benchmarking, and holistic evaluation metrics.",
        "Detailed and logically structured experiment plan with clear steps from auditing to dissemination."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Implementation details for the dynamic benchmark infrastructure are sparse, raising concerns about scalability and long-term maintenance.",
        "Adversarial generation and continuous evaluation may face technical hurdles (e.g., computational costs, human-in-the-loop bottlenecks).",
        "Validation of holistic metrics (e.g., explainability scores) lacks a concrete plan for real-world correlation studies.",
        "Potential resistance from the ML community due to the overhead of dynamic evaluation."
