    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a unified multimodal representation learning framework (MAT) that bridges vision, audio, and language modalities through a shared latent space and dynamic modality gating. It leverages self-supervised objectives and a modality-agnostic transformer architecture to handle cross-modal tasks without requiring perfectly aligned data.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Ambitious and timely research question addressing a significant gap in multimodal learning.",
        "Innovative proposed method combining shared latent spaces and dynamic modality gating.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan covering validation, cross-modal alignment, and downstream tasks."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks detailed discussion on computational complexity and scalability of cross-modal attention.",
        "Limited justification for the feasibility of training on weakly aligned web data.",
        "Insufficient ablation studies to isolate the contributions of key components."
