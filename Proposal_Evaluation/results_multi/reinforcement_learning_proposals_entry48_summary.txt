Weaknesses: Lacks detailed discussion on computational resources and scalability, especially in high-dimensional spaces., Potential challenges in meta-learning for prior adaptation are not fully addressed, including convergence and stability issues., Limited discussion on risk assessment and mitigation strategies for cases where priors are highly misaligned., Robustness of uncertainty estimation in high-dimensional spaces is not critically analyzed, which could limit practical applicability.
