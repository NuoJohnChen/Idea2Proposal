    "Summary": "The proposal seeks to develop a unified framework for visualizing and interpreting learned representations in DNNs, combining hierarchical representation dissection, geometry-aware visualization, and dynamic attribution synthesis. It aims to address the limitations of current interpretability methods with a multi-scale, architecture-agnostic approach.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement highlighting the limitations of current interpretability methods.",
        "Ambitious hypothesis proposing a unified, architecture-agnostic framework.",
        "Detailed and technically sound proposed method combining multiple advanced techniques.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan with multiple validation steps."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks discussion on potential technical challenges and risks (e.g., computational complexity, scalability).",
        "Experiment plan may be overly ambitious given the scope.",
        "Validation plan could benefit from more critical analyses like ablation studies.",
        "Limited discussion on how the proposed method will handle real-world noise and variability."

    "Questions": [
        "What are the computational requirements for the proposed methods, especially for large-scale models?",
        "How will the framework handle models with vastly different architectures (e.g., CNNs vs. transformers)?",
        "What are the potential failure modes of the dynamic attribution synthesis?",
        "How will the framework ensure that the interpretations are clinically relevant in healthcare applications?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "Potential high computational complexity due to the complexity of the proposed methods.",
        "Scalability issues when applied to very large models or datasets.",
        "Dependence on the quality and comprehensiveness of the Broden dataset for hierarchical dissection.",
