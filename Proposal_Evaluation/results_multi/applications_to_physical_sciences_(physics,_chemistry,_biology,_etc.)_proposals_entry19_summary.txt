Weaknesses: Novelty of combining GNNs with physics-informed features for HEAs is not entirely unprecedented., Lacks detailed discussion on potential technical challenges (e.g., data scarcity, interpretability of attention mechanisms)., Baseline comparisons could be more explicitly justified., Evaluation metrics could be more comprehensive (e.g., including uncertainty quantification).
