    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a unified representation learning framework for vision, audio, and language modalities, leveraging cross-modal attention and dynamic feature fusion. It addresses the fragmentation in current modality-specific approaches and proposes innovations in tokenization, transformer architecture, and pretraining objectives. The experiment plan is comprehensive, covering validation, benchmarking, transfer learning, efficiency analysis, and ablation studies.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Ambitious and well-articulated problem statement.",
        "Clear hypothesis with innovative components like modality-agnostic tokenization and cross-modal contrastive objectives.",
        "Detailed proposed method with modular tokenizer pipeline and efficient attention mechanisms.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan covering validation, benchmarking, transfer learning, efficiency analysis, and ablation studies."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks discussion on potential failure modes and alternative approaches.",
        "Concerns about scalability and computational costs are not fully addressed.",
        "Limited detail on how the proposed method will handle misaligned or noisy multimodal data.",
        "Baseline comparisons could be more detailed to ensure fairness and rigor."

    "Questions": [
        "How will the proposed method handle cases where one modality is missing or corrupted?",
        "What are the expected computational costs for training the proposed model, and how will they be managed?",
        "How will the dynamic feature gating mechanism be validated to ensure it selects relevant modalities effectively?",
        "What are the fallback strategies if the primary pretraining objectives fail to achieve the desired alignment?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "Potential high computational costs due to the complexity of the model.",
        "Risk of overfitting to specific datasets or tasks, given the broad scope of modalities.",
