    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a hierarchical imitation learning framework with latent subgoals for long-horizon planning in robotics. It aims to address scalability and generalization issues in current methods by combining learned latent subgoals with adaptive refinement. The framework includes three components: latent subgoal learning, hierarchical policy architecture, and adaptive subgoal refinement. The experiment plan covers validation, benchmarking, refinement evaluation, real-world deployment, and scalability analysis.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement identifying gaps in current methods.",
        "Novel combination of hierarchical IL and latent subgoals with adaptive refinement.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan with multiple stages of validation."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Intellectual depth is moderate; latent subgoals are not entirely novel.",
        "Execution credibility is a concern, particularly for real-world deployment.",
        "Scientific rigor could be improved with more exhaustive baseline comparisons and deeper ablation studies."

    "Questions": [
        "How will the framework handle extreme distributional shifts not covered in the training data?",
        "What are the computational limits of the proposed transformer-based low-level policy?",
        "How will the rollback mechanism be implemented to ensure real-time performance?",
        "How will the VAE handle mode collapse or poor generalization in the latent subgoal space?",
        "Can you provide more technical details on the rollback mechanism and adaptive refinement training?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "Potential challenges in real-world deployment due to unforeseen environmental complexities.",
        "Limited discussion on the interpretability of the latent subgoal space.",
        "Scalability to very complex tasks may be constrained by computational resources.",
