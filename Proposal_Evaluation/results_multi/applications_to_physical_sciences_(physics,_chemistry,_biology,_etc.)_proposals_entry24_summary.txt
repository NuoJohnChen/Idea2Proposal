Weaknesses: Narrative is somewhat disjointed, with a less-than-smooth transition from problem statement to proposed method., Core insight feels incremental rather than groundbreaking, lacking sufficient differentiation from existing work., Lacks detail on how key challenges (e.g., data scarcity, model interpretability) will be addressed., Validation plan could be more rigorous, with clearer outlines for experimental validation and discussion of potential failure modes.
