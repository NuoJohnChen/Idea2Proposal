    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a unified framework for deep learning on non-Euclidean geometries by combining geometric scattering transforms, adaptive spectral filtering, and hierarchical pooling. It addresses limitations in expressive power and scalability of current methods, with a comprehensive validation plan covering synthetic tasks, scalability benchmarks, and real-world applications.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and significant problem statement addressing key limitations in non-Euclidean deep learning.",
        "Ambitious and novel approach combining geometric scattering transforms, adaptive spectral filtering, and hierarchical pooling.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan covering synthetic, scalability, and real-world tasks, including ablation studies.",
