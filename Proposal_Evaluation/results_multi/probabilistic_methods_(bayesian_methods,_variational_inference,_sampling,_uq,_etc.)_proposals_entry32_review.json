    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a hybrid framework combining adaptive variational inference, scalable MCMC, and uncertainty-aware deep architectures to bridge Bayesian methods and deep learning. It addresses scalability and robustness challenges in current probabilistic methods and aims to provide tractable uncertainty quantification for large-scale deep learning models.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement highlighting the limitations of current Bayesian methods in deep learning.",
        "Ambitious hypothesis proposing a hybrid framework to address scalability and robustness challenges.",
        "Detailed proposed method leveraging normalizing flows, gradient-based tempered MCMC, and probabilistic layers.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan covering synthetic tasks, high-dimensional posteriors, deep architectures, real-world applications, and computational efficiency."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks depth in addressing potential technical challenges (e.g., convergence guarantees for adaptive VI, computational overhead of Hessian-vector products).",
        "Risks (e.g., scalability to billion-parameter models) are not thoroughly discussed.",
        "Validation plan could benefit from more critical analyses (e.g., failure modes of gradient-based tempered MCMC)."
