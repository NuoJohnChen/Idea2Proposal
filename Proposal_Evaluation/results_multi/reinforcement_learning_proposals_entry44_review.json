    "Summary": "The proposal introduces Adaptive Prior RL (APRL), a framework that dynamically balances model-based and model-free RL components using an uncertainty-aware prior and a dynamic weighting mechanism. The goal is to improve sample efficiency and generalization while avoiding compounding errors and computational overhead.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement highlighting limitations of current hybrid RL methods.",
        "Compelling hypothesis about dynamic balancing of model-based and model-free components based on uncertainty and task horizon.",
        "Innovative integration of uncertainty-aware modeling, dynamic weighting, and efficient planning.",
        "Comprehensive experimental plan with benchmarks against state-of-the-art methods and scalability tests."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks detailed discussion on computational overhead of the gating network and Bayesian neural networks.",
        "Scalability of Bayesian neural networks in high-dimensional spaces is not thoroughly addressed.",
        "Experimental plan could benefit from more detailed ablation studies and failure mode analyses.",
        "Potential challenges in real-world deployment (e.g., partial observability, noisy data) are not fully explored."

        "How robust is the uncertainty estimation in high-dimensional or noisy environments?",
        "What are the fallback mechanisms if the dynamic weighting fails to converge or provides conflicting actions?"

    "Limitations": [
        "Potential computational overhead from the gating network and Bayesian neural networks.",
        "Scalability to very high-dimensional observation spaces may be limited.",
        "Robustness in partially observable or non-stationary environments is unclear.",
