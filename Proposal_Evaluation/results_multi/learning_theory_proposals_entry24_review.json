    "Summary": "The proposal aims to bridge the gap between empirical success and theoretical understanding in deep learning by developing a trajectory-dependent learning theory. It hypothesizes that generalization in DNNs is governed by implicit regularization mechanisms and proposes a new complexity measure, trajectory complexity, to capture this. The method includes theoretical derivation, empirical validation on synthetic tasks, and benchmarking against traditional theories.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Addresses a critical and timely issue in deep learning.",
        "Ambitious hypothesis with potential to reshape the field.",
        "Comprehensive experimental plan covering synthetic and real-world validation.",
        "Strong scientific rigor with a well-designed validation plan."

    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks specificity in the exact formulation of trajectory complexity.",
        "Uncertain feasibility of some experiments, especially with large language models.",
        "Execution plan could benefit from more concrete details on overcoming technical challenges."
