    "Summary": "The proposal introduces Dynamic Latent Generative Models (DLGM) to improve computational efficiency in generative models without sacrificing sample quality. It combines input-adaptive diffusion scheduling, content-sparse autoregressive attention, and unified training via latent balancing. The experiments plan to validate the approach across images, text, audio, and video, with ablation studies and benchmarking against state-of-the-art methods.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement identifying limitations in current generative models.",
        "Innovative hypothesis on input-dependent latent dynamics with potential for significant impact.",
        "Technically sound proposed methods building on established work.",
        "Thorough experiment plan covering multiple modalities and ablation studies."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Feasibility concerns with the dynamic scheduler implementation and gating mechanism.",
        "Lack of detailed discussion on potential failure modes and mitigation strategies.",
        "Potential computational overhead of the proposed innovations."

        "Potential for increased model complexity due to dynamic components.",
        "Risk of inconsistent sample quality if dynamic decisions are not well-calibrated.",
        "Generalization to unseen modalities may require significant tuning."
