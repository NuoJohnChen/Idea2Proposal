    "Summary": "The proposal introduces Adaptive Latent Diffusion (ALD), a framework to enhance the efficiency and controllability of generative models by integrating adaptive noise schedules and disentangled latent spaces. It aims to address the trade-offs between sample quality, diversity, and computational overhead in current diffusion models.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement highlighting the limitations of current diffusion models.",
        "Innovative hypothesis combining dynamic noise scheduling and disentangled latent spaces.",
        "Comprehensive experimental plan covering validation, disentanglement quantification, benchmarking, and efficiency analysis."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks detailed technical specifics on the implementation of adaptive noise scheduling and disentangled latent spaces.",
        "Experimental plan is somewhat generic and lacks depth in addressing potential technical challenges.",
        "Limited discussion on how the proposed method will handle training stability and convergence."

        "How will the lightweight neural scheduler for adaptive noise scheduling be designed and trained?",
        "What specific architectures will be used for the split latent encoder and factor-aware diffusion process?",
        "How will the proposed method ensure training stability and convergence, especially with the added complexity of disentangled latent spaces?",
        "How will the proposed disentangled latent spaces handle complex, real-world data where factors may not be easily separable?",
        "What are the fallback options if the parallel denoising approach does not yield the expected efficiency gains?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "Potential challenges in training the adaptive noise scheduler end-to-end with the diffusion model.",
        "Risk of increased computational overhead due to the added complexity of disentangled latent spaces.",
        "Uncertainty about the scalability of parallel subspace denoising to high-dimensional latent spaces."
