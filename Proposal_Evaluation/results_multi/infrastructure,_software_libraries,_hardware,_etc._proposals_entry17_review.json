    "Summary": "The proposal aims to optimize distributed training infrastructure for large-scale AI models through a hardware-software co-design approach. It identifies critical bottlenecks in current frameworks and proposes a unified solution to improve communication efficiency, memory utilization, and hardware performance. The method includes a communication-efficient software stack, memory-optimized training pipeline, and hardware-accelerated backend, with a detailed experiment plan to validate the approach.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement with relevant citations.",
        "Strong motivation and hypothesis grounded in recent literature.",
        "Comprehensive proposed method covering multiple aspects of optimization.",
        "Detailed and structured experiment plan with clear metrics and benchmarks."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks explicit discussion of potential technical challenges and risks, especially in hardware acceleration.",
        "Baseline comparisons could be more explicitly justified to ensure fairness.",
        "Limited discussion on the scalability of the proposed solutions beyond the described experiments."
