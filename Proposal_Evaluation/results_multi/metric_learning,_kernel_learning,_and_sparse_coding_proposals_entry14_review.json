    "Summary": "The proposal seeks to unify metric learning, kernel learning, and sparse coding into a single framework to address limitations in scalability, computational cost, and adaptability. It hypothesizes that combining these techniques can yield a robust, interpretable, and efficient representation learning method. The proposed method involves kernelized metric learning with adaptive sparsity, dynamic kernel selection, and end-to-end optimization. Experiments include synthetic data validation, benchmarking on standard tasks, scalability analysis, ablation studies, and real-world deployment.",
