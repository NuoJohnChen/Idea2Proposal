    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a unified representation learning framework across vision, audio, and language modalities using a modality-agnostic encoder with dynamic cross-modal attention and self-supervised objectives. The experiment plan includes unimodal benchmarks, cross-modal transfer, ablation studies, scalability tests, and generalization to novel modalities.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Ambitious and intellectually deep hypothesis proposing a unified representation learning framework.",
        "Well-articulated problem statement highlighting limitations of current methods.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan covering a wide range of evaluations.",
        "Leverages advanced techniques like transformers, dynamic attention, and self-supervised learning."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks detailed discussion of technical challenges in designing a modality-agnostic encoder.",
        "Dynamic cross-modal attention mechanism described at a high level without concrete details.",
        "Scalability and computational overhead concerns are not thoroughly addressed.",
        "Overly ambitious claims about zero-shot transfer to novel modalities."
