    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a multiscale neural operator (MNO) to accelerate simulations in physical sciences by combining neural operators with domain-specific inductive biases. It aims to address limitations of current methods like FNOs and PINNs by incorporating adaptive resolution mechanisms and physics-aware attention. The proposed method includes a physics-informed architecture, conservation-law constraints, and an efficient training pipeline. The experiment plan covers canonical PDEs, molecular dynamics, multiphysics systems, ablation studies, and real-world applications.",
