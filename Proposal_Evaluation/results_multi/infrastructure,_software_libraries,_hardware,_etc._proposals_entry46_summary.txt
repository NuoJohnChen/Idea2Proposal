Weaknesses: Lacks detailed discussion on potential challenges in implementing adaptive communication protocols and runtime optimizations., Feasibility of integrating solutions into existing frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow is not thoroughly addressed., Scalability claims (e.g., 50% reduction in communication overhead) need empirical validation; preliminary results or simulations would strengthen the proposal., Limited discussion on potential failure modes and extreme cases (e.g., highly sparse gradients, heterogeneous hardware).
