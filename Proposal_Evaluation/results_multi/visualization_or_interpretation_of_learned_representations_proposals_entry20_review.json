    "Summary": "The proposal aims to improve the interpretability of deep neural networks by combining hierarchical feature visualization, disentanglement via contrastive learning, and quantitative interpretability metrics. The authors plan to benchmark existing methods, validate their hierarchical visualization approach, test disentanglement probes, evaluate downstream utility, and scale to language models.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement addressing a significant gap in deep learning interpretability.",
        "Detailed and structured experiment plan.",
        "Integration of multiple existing techniques into a unified framework.",
        "Solid scientific rigor with clear benchmarking and validation plans."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Novelty is limited; the proposed method is largely a combination of existing techniques.",
        "Execution plan is ambitious, particularly in scaling to language models, but feasible with expertise.",
        "Lack of critical analysis of potential failure modes or limitations of the proposed methods."

    "Questions": [
        "How will the proposed method handle cases where features are inherently entangled and cannot be disentangled?",
        "What specific advantages does the proposed framework offer over existing methods in terms of interpretability?",
        "How will the authors ensure that the quantitative interpretability metrics are not biased towards their own method?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "The proposed method may struggle with highly complex or inherently entangled features.",
        "Scaling to language models may introduce additional challenges not addressed in the proposal.",
        "The quantitative interpretability metrics may not fully capture human interpretability."
