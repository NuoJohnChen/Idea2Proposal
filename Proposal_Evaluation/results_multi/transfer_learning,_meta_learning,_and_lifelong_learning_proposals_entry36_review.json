        "Ambitious and novel integration of three distinct learning paradigms",
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement identifying gaps in existing paradigms",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan covering benchmarks, ablation studies, and real-world deployment tests",
        "Strong scientific rigor with planned ablation studies and stress tests",
        "Innovative architectural design combining multiple advanced techniques"
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Overly ambitious scope may compromise feasibility",
        "Lacks detailed discussion of technical integration challenges",
        "Insufficient consideration of potential failure modes",
        "Execution credibility is questionable due to the ambitious scope",
