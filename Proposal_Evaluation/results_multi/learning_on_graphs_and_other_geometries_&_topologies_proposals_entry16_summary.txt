Weaknesses: Limited discussion on computational bottlenecks, especially for TDA features., Insufficient detail on practical challenges of curvature-regularized optimization., Potential scalability issues with large-scale datasets., Feasibility of integrating TDA with GNNs at scale is not fully addressed., Lack of detailed risk mitigation strategies for technical challenges., Scalability to very large graphs (>1M nodes) is not convincingly addressed.
