    "Summary": "The proposal seeks to unify metric learning, kernel learning, and sparse coding into a joint framework to overcome their individual limitations. It proposes a three-part method involving metric-regularized kernel learning, sparse coding with metric-aware dictionaries, and unified optimization via alternating minimization. The experiment plan includes synthetic validation, benchmarking, scalability tests, interpretability analysis, and downstream task evaluation.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement identifying gaps in existing methods.",
