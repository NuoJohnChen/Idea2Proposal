    "Summary": "The proposal aims to improve the interpretability of deep neural networks by combining disentangled representation learning with interactive visualization and interpretability-aware training. It hypothesizes that current methods lack explicit constraints for interpretability and proposes a unified framework to address this. The experiment plan includes benchmarking disentanglement methods, validating semantic regularization, developing a visualization tool, testing interpretability-aware training, and conducting real-world case studies.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Addresses a significant and timely problem in deep learning.",
        "Proposes a unified framework combining disentanglement and visualization.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan with multiple validation steps."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Semantic regularization lacks implementation details (e.g., loss functions, hyperparameters).",
        "Visualization tool differentiation from existing solutions (e.g., TensorFlow Embedding Projector) is unclear.",
        "Interpretability-aware training integration (e.g., multi-objective optimization weights) is underspecified.",
        "No discussion of computational overhead from added regularization/visualization.",
        "Scalability to large models (e.g., ViTs, LLMs) is unaddressed."
