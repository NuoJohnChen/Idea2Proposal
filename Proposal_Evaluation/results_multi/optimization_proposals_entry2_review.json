    "Summary": "The proposal introduces Adaptive Gradient Filters (AGF), a new class of optimizers designed for non-stationary objectives. AGF integrates non-stationarity detection, dynamic memory adaptation, and kernel-based gradient filtering to improve convergence and generalization in dynamic environments. The method is validated through synthetic benchmarks, distribution shifts, reinforcement learning, and large-scale language modeling.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement addressing a relevant gap in optimization methods.",
        "Innovative approach with potential for significant impact.",
