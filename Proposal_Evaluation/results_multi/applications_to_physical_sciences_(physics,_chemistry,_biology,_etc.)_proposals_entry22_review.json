    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a deep learning framework combining graph neural networks (GNNs) with symmetry-aware attention mechanisms to accelerate the discovery of quantum materials. It addresses the limitations of current methods, such as high computational cost and poor generalization, and proposes a hybrid model trained on DFT data and experimental measurements. The method includes developing a symmetry-adapted graph representation, multi-task learning for quantum properties, and an active learning loop for material discovery. The experiment plan covers benchmarking, model development, multi-task learning, active learning, and experimental validation.",
