    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a unified multimodal representation learning framework that bridges vision, audio, and language modalities. It hypothesizes that a modality-agnostic transformer backbone with a unified training objective can outperform specialized models and enable zero-shot cross-modal transfer. The method includes a shared architecture, combined training objectives (masked modeling, contrastive alignment, and modality-invariant regularization), and strategies for efficient scaling. The experiment plan covers validation, benchmarking, scaling, efficiency analysis, and ablation studies.",
