    "Summary": "The proposal aims to improve the sample efficiency of reinforcement learning (RL) by introducing adaptive model-based priors, combining hierarchical latent dynamics, uncertainty-driven planning, and meta-learned priors. The approach is validated through experiments in toy environments, benchmark comparisons, and real-world robot tasks.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-motivated problem statement.",
        "Innovative hypothesis integrating hierarchical latent dynamics, uncertainty-driven planning, and meta-learned priors.",
        "Detailed and comprehensive experiment plan with multiple benchmarks and ablation studies.",
        "Potential for significant impact on RL sample efficiency and adaptability."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Feasibility concerns about integrating all proposed components seamlessly.",
        "Limited discussion on potential technical challenges and mitigation strategies.",
        "High computational resource requirements, especially for real-world validation."

    "Questions": [
        "How will the proposed method handle cases where the hierarchical latent dynamics fail to disentangle global and local factors effectively?",
        "What are the specific computational budget constraints for the uncertainty-driven planning, and how will they be optimized?",
        "How will the meta-learned priors generalize to entirely novel tasks outside the training distribution?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "Integration of hierarchical latent dynamics and uncertainty-driven planning may introduce complexity and instability.",
        "Real-world validation may be limited by hardware constraints and environmental variability.",
        "Meta-learning performance may degrade with significant distribution shifts."
