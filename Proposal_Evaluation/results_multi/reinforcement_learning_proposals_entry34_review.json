    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a framework for efficient multi-task reinforcement learning (MTRL) by disentangling shared and task-specific latent dynamics. It combines variational autoencoders, contrastive learning, and model-based RL with a dynamics attention mechanism to improve sample efficiency and enable zero-shot generalization. The experiment plan includes synthetic benchmarking, robotic manipulation, generalization tests, real-world validation, and scalability analysis.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement highlighting limitations of current MTRL methods.",
        "Novel hypothesis extending latent world models to multi-task settings.",
        "Technically sound proposed method combining VAEs, contrastive learning, and model-based RL.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan covering multiple domains and scalability."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lack of detailed discussion on potential technical challenges (e.g., dynamics attention mechanism robustness).",
        "Feasibility concerns around zero-shot task composition and scalability to large task sets.",
        "Validation plan could benefit from more critical analyses (e.g., failure modes, ablation studies)."

    "Questions": [

        "What are the potential failure modes of the disentanglement process, and how will they be mitigated?",
        "How will the method scale to tasks with vastly different dynamics (e.g., locomotion vs. manipulation)?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "Potential difficulty in disentangling highly correlated shared and task-specific dynamics.",
        "Robustness of the method to noisy or incomplete observations.",
        "Computational overhead of maintaining separate latent spaces and scaling to large task sets."
