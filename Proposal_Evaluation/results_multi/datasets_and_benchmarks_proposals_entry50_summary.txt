Weaknesses: Lacks transformative novelty; core ideas are incremental improvements over existing work., Feasibility concerns regarding scalability and practical challenges of continuous adversarial data collection., Lack of detailed discussion on potential technical hurdles and risks, such as quality control of crowdsourced data or computational costs., Ethical implications of synthetic data augmentation and crowdsourced adversarial examples are not sufficiently addressed.
