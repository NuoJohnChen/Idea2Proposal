    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a theoretical framework for understanding adaptive learning dynamics in non-convex optimization, focusing on gradient-based optimizers like SGD and Adam. It hypothesizes that adaptive methods exhibit distinct dynamical regimes that can be formalized through stochastic differential equations (SDEs), and proposes a combination of theoretical analysis and empirical validation to test this hypothesis.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement.",
        "Strong motivation with a compelling hypothesis.",
        "Innovative proposed method combining theoretical and empirical approaches.",
        "Detailed and systematic experiment plan.",
        "High scientific rigor with comprehensive validation."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Feasibility of deriving SDE approximations for Adam-like optimizers is uncertain.",
        "Practical implementation of noise-injection mechanisms may be challenging.",
        "Potential technical challenges in aligning theoretical predictions with empirical results."
