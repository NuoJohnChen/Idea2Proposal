Weaknesses: Lacks detailed discussion on computational challenges, especially scaling to 1B parameters., Unclear specifics on constructing unseen modality combinations for zero-shot transfer evaluation., Potential technical challenges in dynamic margin adjustment are not thoroughly addressed., Real-world deployment section could be more concrete., Limited discussion on how to handle modality-specific noise in practice.
