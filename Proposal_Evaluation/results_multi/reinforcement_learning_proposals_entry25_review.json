    "Summary": "The proposal introduces AMP-RL, a novel framework for efficient reinforcement learning by adaptively combining model-based and model-free methods. It addresses high sample complexity and model bias issues through uncertainty-adaptive weighting, model-guided exploration, and hierarchical policy learning. The experiment plan is comprehensive, covering validation, exploration efficiency, hierarchical policy assessment, scalability, and ablation studies.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement highlighting limitations of current RL methods.",
        "Innovative approach combining model-based and model-free RL.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan with multiple validation steps and ablation studies.",
