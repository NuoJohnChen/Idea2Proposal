    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a theoretical framework for adaptive synaptic plasticity in dynamic environments, addressing limitations of traditional Hebbian learning. It hypothesizes that dynamically modulating learning rates based on local uncertainty signals can outperform existing methods. The proposed method includes an uncertainty-guided plasticity rule, a synaptic gating mechanism, and network-level convergence guarantees. The experiment plan spans synthetic tasks, biological plausibility, scaling to deep networks, theoretical analysis, and real-world robustness.",
