Weaknesses: Lack of detail on seamless integration of diverse methods (CMA-ES, SGD, RL)., Unclear efficiency of training the RL policy for adaptive switching., Potential scalability issues with surrogate-assisted ES in high-dimensional spaces., Ambiguous theoretical guarantees and their robustness., Overly ambitious real-world deployment claims without clear pathways.
