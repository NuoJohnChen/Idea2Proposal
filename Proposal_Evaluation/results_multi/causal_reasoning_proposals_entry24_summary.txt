Decision: Accept
Weaknesses: Feasibility concerns regarding the integration of complex components (VAE, differentiable causal discovery, intervention-aware training)., Limited discussion on potential failure modes or challenges in handling real-world high-dimensional data., Experimental plan, while thorough, may lack depth in addressing the robustness of the proposed architecture., Reliance on synthetic data for initial validation may not fully capture the complexities of real-world scenarios.
