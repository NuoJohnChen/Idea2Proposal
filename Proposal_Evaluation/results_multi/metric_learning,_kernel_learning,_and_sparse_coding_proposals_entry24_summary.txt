Overall Quality: 6
Argumentative Cohesion: 7
Intellectual Depth: 7
Execution Credibility: 6
Scientific Rigor: 7
Decision: Reject
Weaknesses: Lack of detailed discussion on optimization challenges, particularly with non-smooth sparsity terms., Baseline comparisons could be more explicitly justified., Execution credibility is somewhat undermined by insufficient risk mitigation strategies., Novelty is somewhat incremental given prior work on deep kernel learning and sparse metric learning.
