    "Summary": "The proposal aims to optimize distributed training infrastructure for large-scale AI models through a hardware-software co-design approach. It addresses communication overheads, memory fragmentation, and hardware underutilization by proposing topology-aware communication scheduling, compiler-assisted memory management, and hardware-software co-design for heterogeneous systems. The experiment plan includes benchmarking, validation of scheduling, memory management evaluation, CXL-enabled memory disaggregation, and end-to-end training efficiency.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Well-articulated problem statement highlighting critical bottlenecks in current frameworks.",
        "Strong motivation supported by recent literature.",
        "Comprehensive proposed method targeting multiple aspects of distributed training.",
        "Detailed experiment plan with relevant metrics."

    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks depth in discussing potential technical challenges and risks, particularly in hardware-software co-design.",
        "Validation plan could benefit from more critical analyses, such as ablation studies.",
        "Limited discussion on the scalability of the proposed solutions beyond the 256-GPU cluster.",
        "High dependency on emerging hardware (e.g., CXL) introduces significant technical uncertainty."
