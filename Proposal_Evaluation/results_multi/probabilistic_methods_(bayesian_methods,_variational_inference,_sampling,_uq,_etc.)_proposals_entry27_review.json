    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a scalable and robust probabilistic inference framework by combining adaptive variational inference, stochastic gradient MCMC, and uncertainty-aware deep learning. It targets the limitations of current probabilistic methods in scalability and approximation quality, with applications in large-scale deep learning tasks.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement identifying key limitations in current probabilistic methods.",
        "Ambitious hypothesis proposing a hybrid framework to bridge Bayesian methods and deep learning.",
        "Detailed proposed method with a three-part framework.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan covering synthetic and real-world datasets."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks depth in discussing potential technical challenges and risks, especially in scaling to large datasets.",
        "Validation plan could benefit from more critical analysis of failure modes.",
        "Limited discussion on the computational overhead of the hybrid approach."
