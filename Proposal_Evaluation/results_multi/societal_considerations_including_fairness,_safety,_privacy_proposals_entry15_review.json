    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a dynamic trade-off optimization framework to jointly address fairness, safety, and privacy in AI systems. It aims to overcome the limitations of current isolated mitigation strategies by developing a unified metric design, interaction-aware training, and system-level auditing. The experiment plan includes benchmarking trade-offs, validating joint optimization, real-world deployment simulation, longitudinal auditing, and comparative analysis.",
