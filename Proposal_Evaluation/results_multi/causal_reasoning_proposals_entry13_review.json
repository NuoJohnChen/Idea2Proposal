    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a hybrid neural architecture integrating causal reasoning through latent causal variable discovery, dynamic causal graph inference, and counterfactual-augmented training. It targets improved out-of-distribution generalization and causal inference in high-dimensional data, with a comprehensive experiment plan covering synthetic benchmarks, real-world applications, and scalability tests.",
