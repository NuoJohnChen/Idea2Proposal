    "Summary": "The proposal aims to address the limitations of current machine learning benchmarks by introducing dynamic, multi-dimensional evaluation frameworks. It focuses on three main components: dynamic dataset curation, multi-dimensional evaluation metrics, and a benchmarking infrastructure. The goal is to provide more accurate measures of model generalization and robustness.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement backed by recent literature.",
        "Strong motivation and hypothesis that dynamic benchmarks will improve model evaluation.",
        "Comprehensive proposed method with three distinct components.",
        "Detailed and logically structured experiment plan."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks specific technical details on dynamic dataset curation implementation.",
        "Unclear how the benchmarking infrastructure will handle scalability and reproducibility challenges.",
        "Potential risks in crowd-sourcing and adversarial example generation are not fully addressed."
