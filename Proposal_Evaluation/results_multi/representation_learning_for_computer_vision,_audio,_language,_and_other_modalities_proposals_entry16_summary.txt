Weaknesses: Lacks clear discussion of potential technical challenges, such as designing a truly modality-agnostic tokenizer., Dynamic architecture switching may introduce significant computational overhead, not adequately addressed., Cross-modal contrastive objective may face difficulties in aligning highly disparate modalities like audio and text., Experiment plan does not explicitly address failure modes or robustness testing.
