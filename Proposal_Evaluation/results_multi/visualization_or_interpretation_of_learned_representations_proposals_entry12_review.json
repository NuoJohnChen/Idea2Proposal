    "Summary": "The proposal aims to enhance the interpretability of deep neural networks by developing a unified framework for visualizing and disentangling learned features. It integrates concept activation vectors (CAVs), dynamic feature ablation, and latent interventions to create hierarchical, human-understandable explanations. The method is validated through concept localization, disentanglement efficacy, downstream task performance, and scalability tests.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and cohesive narrative linking problem statement to proposed solution.",
        "Integration of multiple advanced techniques (CAVs, dynamic masking, latent interventions).",
        "Comprehensive validation plan including human studies and scalability tests.",
        "Potential for practical impact in improving model interpretability and trust."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Scalability to very large models (e.g., ViT-22B) is not fully demonstrated.",
        "Limited discussion of failure modes or scenarios where the method might underperform.",
        "Generalizability across diverse architectures is not thoroughly addressed."

        "Potential high computational cost for real-time operation on large models.",
        "Limited generalizability to non-vision or non-multimodal tasks.",
        "Dependence on pre-defined concept labels (e.g., Broden) may restrict open-world applicability."
