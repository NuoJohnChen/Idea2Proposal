Weaknesses: Lacks depth in discussing potential technical challenges and risks, particularly in dynamic communication scheduling and adaptive hardware mapping., Novelty is somewhat incremental, with limited differentiation from existing frameworks like Megatron-LM and DeepSpeed., Feasibility concerns regarding integration with existing frameworks and generalization to heterogeneous hardware setups., Validation plan could benefit from more critical analyses, such as exploring failure modes or edge cases.
