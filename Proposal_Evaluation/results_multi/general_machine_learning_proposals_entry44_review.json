    "Summary": "The proposal aims to improve machine learning model robustness under distribution shifts by combining self-supervised pretraining, distributionally robust fine-tuning, and causal regularization. It targets out-of-distribution generalization, a significant challenge in real-world applications. The experimental plan includes standard benchmarks, synthetic data, large-scale pretraining, real-world deployment, and theoretical analysis.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and cohesive narrative linking problem to solution.",
        "Innovative combination of self-supervised learning, DRO, and causal regularization.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan with multiple evaluation scenarios.",
