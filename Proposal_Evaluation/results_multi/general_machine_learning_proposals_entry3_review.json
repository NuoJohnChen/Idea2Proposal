    "Summary": "The proposal addresses distribution shift and out-of-domain generalization in machine learning by combining self-supervised invariant learning, causal representation learning, and test-time adaptation. It hypothesizes that learning domain-invariant features and causal structures can improve model robustness. The experimental plan includes synthetic benchmarking, domain generalization benchmarks, causal ablation studies, real-world deployment testing, and efficiency analysis.",
