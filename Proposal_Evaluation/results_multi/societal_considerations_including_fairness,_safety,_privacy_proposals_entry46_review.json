    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a 'societal alignment' framework to jointly optimize fairness, safety, and privacy in AI systems. It includes dynamic fairness metrics, safety-constrained training, and bias-aware privacy, with a detailed experiment plan covering benchmarking, training, testing, integration, and real-world deployment.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Addresses a critical and timely issue in AI systems.",
        "Well-articulated problem statement with clear gaps identified.",
        "Compelling hypothesis supported by literature.",
        "Innovative components in the proposed method.",
        "Detailed and comprehensive experiment plan.",
        "Includes a longitudinal real-world study."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Feasibility of integrating all components into a single pipeline is uncertain.",
        "Lacks discussion on computational costs and scalability.",
        "Potential conflicts between fairness, safety, and privacy are not addressed.",
        "Real-world deployment (e.g., healthcare) is ambitious and risky."

    "Questions": [
        "How will conflicts between fairness, safety, and privacy objectives be resolved?",
        "What are the computational costs and scalability limits of the proposed framework?",
        "How will the dynamic fairness metrics be validated against evolving societal norms?",
        "What safeguards are in place for the real-world deployment, especially in sensitive domains like healthcare?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "Integration of all components into a single pipeline may be technically challenging.",
