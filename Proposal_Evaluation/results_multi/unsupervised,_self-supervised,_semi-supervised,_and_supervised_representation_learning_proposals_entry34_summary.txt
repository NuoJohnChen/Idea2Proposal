Weaknesses: Feasibility concerns regarding the dynamic gating mechanism's implementation, scalability, and robustness to noisy labels., Lack of detailed discussion on potential conflicts between the hierarchical objectives and their optimization trade-offs., Unclear how the proposed method will handle extreme label sparsity (e.g., <0.1%) or noisy labels., Limited discussion on computational resources, training time, and infrastructure requirements for large-scale datasets like JFT-300M.
