    "Summary": "The proposal aims to improve the interpretability of deep neural networks by combining disentanglement techniques with interactive visualization. It proposes a hybrid approach using concept bottleneck models and a dynamic visualization interface, with quantitative metrics for evaluating interpretability. The experimental plan includes benchmarking disentanglement methods, validating on real-world datasets, and conducting human-in-the-loop evaluations.",
