Weaknesses: Lacks explicit discussion of potential technical challenges (e.g., computational overhead of gating mechanism)., Scalability of the attention-based fusion layer is not thoroughly addressed., Experimental plan could benefit from more explicit stress tests and failure mode analysis., Potential risks in handling extreme multiscale scenarios are not fully addressed.
