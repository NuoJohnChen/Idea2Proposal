    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a hybrid neural operator architecture that integrates physics-derived constraints (Hamiltonian/Lagrangian formulations) to enhance the accuracy and generalizability of simulations for multiscale physical systems. It aims to outperform traditional numerical methods and purely data-driven ML models by combining the expressivity of neural operators with physical invariants.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement highlighting limitations of existing methods.",
        "Compelling hypothesis integrating domain-specific inductive biases.",
        "Technically sound proposed method with adaptive kernels and operator splitting.",
        "Thorough experiment plan covering canonical PDEs, multiscale systems, and real-world applications.",
        "Strong scientific rigor with planned ablation studies and baseline comparisons."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks detailed discussion on potential technical challenges (e.g., convergence of adaptive kernels).",
        "Novelty over prior work (e.g., physics-informed ML) could be clearer.",
        "Feasibility of HPC deployment needs more substantiation."
