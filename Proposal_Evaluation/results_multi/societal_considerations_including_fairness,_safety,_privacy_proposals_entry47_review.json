    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a dynamic, context-aware framework to jointly optimize fairness, safety, and privacy in AI systems. It addresses gaps in current approaches by integrating intersectional fairness audits, adversarial robustness testing, and adaptive privacy budgets. The experiment plan includes benchmarking, training, stress testing, and longitudinal deployment.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Timely and critical problem statement.",
        "Ambitious and novel hypothesis.",
        "Comprehensive and detailed experiment plan.",
        "Strong scientific rigor with fair baselines and thorough evaluation metrics.",
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement.",
        "Integration of multiple dimensions (fairness, safety, privacy) into a unified framework."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Feasibility concerns due to the ambitious scope and complexity.",
        "Lack of detailed discussion on technical challenges and mitigation strategies.",
        "Potential overpromising given the complexity of integrating all three components.",
        "Limited discussion on scalability and practical deployment challenges.",
        "Ethical implications of deployment in high-stakes domains are under-discussed.",
        "Lacks specificity in how the integration of the three components will be achieved."
