    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a unified representation learning framework across vision, audio, and language modalities, addressing the fragmentation in current modality-specific methods. It proposes a modality-agnostic framework with shared latent spaces and adaptive attention mechanisms, leveraging cross-modal self-supervision and latent space alignment.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Ambitious and intellectually deep hypothesis.",
        "Clear problem statement highlighting limitations of existing methods.",
        "Novel integration of advanced techniques (e.g., masked modeling, adaptive attention, contrastive learning).",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan covering validation, benchmarking, and real-world deployment."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Feasibility of shared tokenizer and dynamic attention mechanism is questionable.",
        "Lacks detailed discussion on technical challenges in aligning unaligned multimodal data.",
        "Scalability concerns for larger and more diverse datasets are not thoroughly addressed.",
        "Real-world deployment section is vague, lacking concrete metrics or evaluation protocols."

    "Questions": [
        "How will the shared tokenizer handle the inherent differences in modality-specific features (e.g., image patches vs. audio spectrogram frames)?",
        "What are the specific technical challenges in implementing the dynamic attention mechanism, and how will they be addressed?",
        "How scalable is the proposed framework to larger and more diverse multimodal datasets?",
        "What are the computational resource requirements for training the unified model?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "Potential difficulty in learning meaningful cross-modal correlations from completely unaligned data.",
        "Risk of the unified architecture becoming a jack-of-all-trades but master of none.",
        "Computational overhead of maintaining modality-specific components while learning shared representations.",
        "Challenge of evaluating true cross-modal understanding versus superficial correlations."
