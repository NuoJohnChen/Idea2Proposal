Weaknesses: Lacks detailed discussion on computational overhead of the gating network and Bayesian neural networks., Scalability of Bayesian neural networks in high-dimensional spaces is not thoroughly addressed., Experimental plan could benefit from more detailed ablation studies and failure mode analyses., Potential challenges in real-world deployment (e.g., partial observability, noisy data) are not fully explored.
