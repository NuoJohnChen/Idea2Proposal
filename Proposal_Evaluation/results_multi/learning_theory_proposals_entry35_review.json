    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a theoretical framework for non-gradient learning dynamics, unifying existing methods under a divergence minimization perspective and designing adaptive hybrid algorithms. It addresses limitations of gradient-based methods in non-differentiable or pathological loss landscapes through a three-part framework involving theoretical unification, geometry-aware learning, and hybrid algorithm design. The comprehensive experiment plan includes synthetic benchmarking, theoretical analysis, RL validation, real-world tasks, and hardware efficiency profiling.",
