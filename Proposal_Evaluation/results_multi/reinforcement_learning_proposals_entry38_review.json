    "Summary": "The proposal introduces an adaptive model-based prior framework for reinforcement learning to improve sample efficiency by dynamically adjusting the model's influence based on predictive confidence. It combines uncertainty-calibrated dynamics models with adaptive weighting and selective rollouts, aiming to balance model-based and model-free learning effectively.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement with well-articulated limitations of current methods.",
        "Innovative combination of uncertainty-calibrated dynamics models and adaptive weighting.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan including validation, benchmarking, ablation studies, and real-world deployment.",
        "Well-motivated hypothesis grounded in recent literature."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks detailed discussion on computational overhead and scalability of the ensemble-based model.",
        "Real-world validation is ambitious but lacks specifics on safety and robustness in physical deployment.",
        "Potential risks in meta-learning the threshold for selective rollouts are not fully addressed.",
        "Limited discussion on failure modes and mitigation strategies."
