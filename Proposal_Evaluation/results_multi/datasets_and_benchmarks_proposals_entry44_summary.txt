Weaknesses: Implementation details for the dynamic benchmark infrastructure are sparse, raising concerns about scalability and long-term maintenance., Adversarial generation and continuous evaluation may face technical hurdles (e.g., computational costs, human-in-the-loop bottlenecks)., Validation of holistic metrics (e.g., explainability scores) lacks a concrete plan for real-world correlation studies., Potential resistance from the ML community due to the overhead of dynamic evaluation.
