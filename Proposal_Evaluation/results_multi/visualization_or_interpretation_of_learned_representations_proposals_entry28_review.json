    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a framework for interpreting neural network representations by combining variational autoencoders with concept activation vectors to achieve sparsity, orthogonality, and alignment of features. It proposes hierarchical concept graphs and an interactive visualization tool for interpretation, with a detailed experiment plan including validation, user studies, and generalization tests.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement.",
        "Innovative combination of techniques for feature disentanglement and visualization.",
        "Detailed and comprehensive experiment plan, including validation, user studies, and generalization tests.",
        "Potential for significant impact on the interpretability of neural networks."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Feasibility concerns about achieving sparsity, orthogonality, and alignment simultaneously.",
        "Scalability of human annotations for concept alignment.",
        "Lack of discussion on computational costs and resource requirements.",
        "Potential biases in human-annotated concepts not addressed."
