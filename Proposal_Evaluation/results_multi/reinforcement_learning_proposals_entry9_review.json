    "Summary": "The proposal introduces adaptive model-based priors to improve sample efficiency in reinforcement learning (RL) by dynamically updating models based on the agent's policy and uncertainty estimates. The proposed method includes uncertainty-aware model adaptation, policy-guided model usage, and efficient planning with adaptive trees. The experiment plan covers validation on toy domains, benchmarking against state-of-the-art methods, evaluating long-horizon generalization, testing real-world robustness, and conducting ablation studies.",
