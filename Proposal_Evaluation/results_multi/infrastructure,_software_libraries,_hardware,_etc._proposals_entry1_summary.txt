Overall Quality: 7
Argumentative Cohesion: 8
Intellectual Depth: 6
Execution Credibility: 7
Scientific Rigor: 7
Decision: Accept
Weaknesses: Intellectual depth is limited; core ideas (gradient compression, RL scheduling) are not novel., Execution plan lacks detailed discussion of technical challenges (e.g., RL training stability, protocol switching overhead)., Scalability claims (1,000+ nodes) are ambitious but not fully substantiated., Potential high computational overhead from dynamic scheduling.
