Weaknesses: Lacks depth in addressing potential technical challenges (e.g., computational overhead of flow-based VI)., Limited discussion on convergence guarantees for adaptive SG-MCMC., Validation plan could benefit from more stress tests on adversarial scenarios or extreme data conditions., Underestimates the complexity of integrating UQ into deep architectures.
