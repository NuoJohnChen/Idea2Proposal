Decision: Accept
Weaknesses: Lacks detailed discussion on potential technical challenges (e.g., convergence of alternating minimization, trade-offs between sparsity and discriminative power)., Feasibility of integrating three distinct paradigms is not thoroughly justified., Experimental plan does not clearly outline how baselines will be selected to ensure fairness (e.g., hyperparameter tuning for all methods)., Insufficient detail on ablation studies to isolate contributions of metric, kernel, and sparse components.
