    "Summary": "The proposal aims to integrate computational models (DDM and RL) with cognitive neuroscience to understand decision-making mechanisms. It hypothesizes that a hybrid DDM-RL model can better explain neural activity and behavior by capturing context-dependent decision processes. The method involves model development, neural data integration, and validation with perturbations. The experiment plan includes benchmark testing, rodent electrophysiology, optogenetic perturbations, human TMS experiments, and cross-species generalizability.",
