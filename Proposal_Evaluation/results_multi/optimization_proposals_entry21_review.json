    "Summary": "The proposal introduces AdaGrad++, a dynamically adaptive optimization framework designed to address limitations of current adaptive gradient methods in non-stationary and sparse optimization landscapes. It proposes three key innovations: temporal gradient coherence detection, sparsity-aware variance scaling, and geometry-informed step size clipping. The experiment plan includes validation on synthetic tasks, NLP, RL, and large-scale models, with a focus on ablation studies and interpretability.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement grounded in empirical observations.",
