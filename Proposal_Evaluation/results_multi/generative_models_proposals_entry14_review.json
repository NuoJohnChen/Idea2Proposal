    "Summary": "The proposal introduces adaptive latent dynamics in generative models to bridge the quality-efficiency gap. It combines input-dependent trajectory learning, latent sparsity, and a unified multimodal architecture, with experiments planned across synthetic data, image/text generation, and hardware-aware optimization.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and compelling problem statement addressing a well-known trade-off in generative models.",
        "Novel and ambitious hypothesis leveraging input-dependent latent trajectories and sparsity.",
        "Comprehensive experimental plan covering multiple modalities and benchmarks.",
        "Strong alignment between problem, hypothesis, and method."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks detailed technical solutions for key components like the latent trajectory controller.",
        "Limited discussion of potential challenges and failure modes.",
        "Execution credibility is questionable due to insufficient detail on overcoming potential challenges.",
        "Scientific rigor could be improved with more detailed ablation studies and failure mode analyses."

    "Questions": [
        "How will the latent trajectory controller be trained to ensure stability and convergence?",

        "How will the model handle cases where input complexity is misestimated?",
        "What are the fallback mechanisms if the adaptive dynamics fail to converge?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "Potential instability in training the latent trajectory controller.",
        "Risk of over-sparsification leading to loss of detail in generated samples.",
        "Complexity of integrating multiple modalities into a single architecture.",
