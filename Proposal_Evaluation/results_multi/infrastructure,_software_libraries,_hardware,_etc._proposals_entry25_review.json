    "Summary": "The proposal aims to optimize distributed training infrastructure for large-scale AI models through a hardware-software co-design approach. It identifies critical bottlenecks in existing frameworks and proposes three key innovations: communication-efficient distributed training, memory optimization, and real-time profiling tools. The experiment plan includes benchmarking, validation, and deployment phases.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement.",
        "Strong motivation and hypothesis grounded in recent literature.",
        "Detailed proposed method with three key innovations.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan covering benchmarking, validation, and deployment."
