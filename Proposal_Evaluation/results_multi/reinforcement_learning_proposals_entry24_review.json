    "Summary": "The proposal introduces Adaptive Model-Based Priors (AMBP), a novel RL framework that dynamically balances model-based and model-free learning using uncertainty estimates. The goal is to improve sample efficiency and robustness in RL tasks, particularly in long-horizon and high-dimensional environments.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement highlighting the limitations of current hybrid RL methods.",
        "Innovative idea of using uncertainty estimates to adaptively blend model-based and model-free updates.",
        "Comprehensive experimental plan covering validation, benchmarking, and real-world deployment."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks detailed technical explanation of how the uncertainty estimator will be integrated into policy optimization.",
        "Meta-optimization objective for learning interpolation weights is not clearly defined.",
        "Limited discussion on computational overhead and scalability trade-offs."
