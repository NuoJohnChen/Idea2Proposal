    "Summary": "The proposal aims to optimize distributed deep learning (DDL) by introducing a hybrid communication protocol and a hardware-aware task scheduler, integrated into a unified library called DistriOpt. It targets communication overhead and hardware underutilization, with experiments planned on benchmark datasets and real-world case studies.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Addresses a significant and timely problem in DDL.",
        "Innovative combination of hybrid communication protocol and hardware-aware scheduling.",
        "Comprehensive experimental plan with benchmarks and real-world case studies.",
        "Clear and cohesive narrative connecting the problem, hypothesis, and proposed solution."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Execution plan lacks depth in addressing technical challenges (e.g., RL-based scheduler complexity).",
        "Overhead of dynamic switching between communication modes is not thoroughly discussed.",
        "Experimental plan could benefit from more critical analyses (e.g., failure modes of hybrid protocol).",
        "Potential underestimation of implementation hurdles."

        "How will the system handle failure modes, such as incorrect mode predictions by the decision model?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "Complexity of RL-based scheduler may limit real-world applicability.",
        "Dynamic switching overhead could negate performance gains.",
        "Potential scalability issues in very large clusters (e.g., 256 nodes)."
