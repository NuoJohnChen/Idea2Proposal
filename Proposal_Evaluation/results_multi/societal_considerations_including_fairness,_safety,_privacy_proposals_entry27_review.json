    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a unified framework for integrating fairness, safety, and privacy in AI systems, addressing the limitations of current siloed approaches. It proposes dynamic fairness metrics, formal safety verification, and a privacy-composability framework, with a comprehensive experiment plan to validate the approach.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Addresses a critical and timely issue in AI systems.",
        "Ambitious hypothesis proposing a dynamic, context-aware solution.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan covering multiple aspects of fairness, safety, and privacy.",
        "Clear and compelling problem statement highlighting the need for a holistic approach."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks depth in execution details, particularly for dynamic fairness metrics and formal safety methods.",
        "Experiment plan is overly ambitious, risking superficial results due to complexity.",
        "Feasibility of integrating formal verification with runtime monitors for LLMs is questionable.",
        "Privacy-composability framework lacks detail on handling real-world complexities."

    "Questions": [
        "How will the dynamic fairness metrics be operationalized in practice, especially for intersectional subgroups?",
        "What are the specific formal methods to be used for safety verification, and how will they scale to large models like GPT-3.5?",
        "How will the privacy-composability framework handle real-world data flows with varying privacy requirements?",
        "How will the proposed framework handle the computational overhead of real-time risk assessment and formal verification?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "Potential over-optimism in achieving holistic alignment of fairness, safety, and privacy.",
        "Scalability of formal safety methods to large-scale models.",
        "Practical implementation challenges in dynamic fairness metrics.",
