    "Summary": "The proposal introduces DyGeM, a framework for generative models with dynamic latent manifolds, aiming to improve sample quality and diversity by adapting the latent space geometry based on input context. The method includes latent space warping, geometric regularization, and efficient sampling via geodesic flow. The experiment plan covers synthetic data validation, image generation benchmarks, scaling to high-dimensional data, ablation studies, and efficiency benchmarking.",
