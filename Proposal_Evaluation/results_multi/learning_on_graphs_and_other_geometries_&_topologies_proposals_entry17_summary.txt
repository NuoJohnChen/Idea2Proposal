Weaknesses: Lacks detailed discussion of potential technical challenges (e.g., computational complexity, stability of geometric scattering transforms)., Execution details for adaptive spectral filtering and hierarchical pooling are somewhat vague., Validation plan could benefit from more diverse baselines and explicit justification of baseline selection., Limited discussion of potential failure modes or alternative approaches if the proposed method underperforms.
