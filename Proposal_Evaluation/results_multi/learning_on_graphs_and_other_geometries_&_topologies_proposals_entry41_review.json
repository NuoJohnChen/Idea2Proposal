    "Summary": "The proposal introduces GTGN, a novel architecture combining geometric-aware parameterization and topological signatures to generalize GNNs to arbitrary geometries and topologies. It addresses limitations of current GNNs through curvature-adaptive message passing, topological signature injection, and dynamic topology rewiring. The experiment plan covers synthetic tests, real-world benchmarks, generalization to non-Euclidean data, ablation studies, and scalability analysis.",
