    "Summary": "The proposal aims to optimize distributed training infrastructure for large-scale AI models through a hardware-software co-design approach, targeting communication inefficiency, memory fragmentation, and hardware underutilization. It proposes a three-part solution: a communication-aware runtime optimizer, unified memory management, and hardware-adaptive parallelism, with a detailed experiment plan for validation.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement.",
        "Strong motivation and hypothesis backed by relevant literature.",
        "Comprehensive proposed method covering multiple optimization aspects.",
        "Detailed and rigorous experiment plan with benchmarking, evaluation, validation, and ablation studies."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Limited discussion on potential technical challenges and risks, particularly in dynamic parallelism planner and heterogeneous accelerator support.",
        "Novelty of each component compared to existing solutions could be more clearly delineated.",
        "Feasibility of some components, like the RL-based planner, could be further justified."

        "What are the fallback mechanisms if the dynamic optimization fails to converge or performs suboptimally?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "The success of the RL-based planner is contingent on the quality of the reward function and training data.",
        "Support for heterogeneous accelerators may introduce additional complexity and overhead.",
        "The proposed optimizations may not generalize well across all types of large-scale models and workloads."
