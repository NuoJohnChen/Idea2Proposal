    "Summary": "The proposal aims to advance deep learning on non-Euclidean domains by unifying geometric priors with adaptive computational mechanisms. It addresses limitations in current GNNs, such as limited expressivity, scalability, and generalization across topologies, through a three-part approach involving geometric message passing, scalable hierarchical representations, and a unified architecture for heterogeneous geometries. The experiment plan is comprehensive, covering synthetic tasks, scalability, and real-world applications.",
