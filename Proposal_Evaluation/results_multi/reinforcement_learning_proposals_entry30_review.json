    "Summary": "The proposal introduces adaptive model-based priors to improve sample efficiency in reinforcement learning by dynamically weighting multiple dynamics models. The method includes uncertainty-calibrated model ensembles, gradient blending with adaptive trust regions, and exploration via directed model disagreement. The experiment plan covers toy environments, MuJoCo tasks, high-dimensional visual domains, and real-world transfer, along with theoretical analysis.",
