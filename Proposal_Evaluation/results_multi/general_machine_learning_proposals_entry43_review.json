    "Summary": "The proposal aims to improve machine learning robustness under distribution shifts by combining causal representation learning with dynamic data reweighting. It outlines a VAE-based framework for disentangling causal features, a meta-learning algorithm for sample reweighting, and gradient alignment for efficient adaptation. The experiment plan includes synthetic and real-world benchmarks, theoretical analysis, and real-world deployment.",
