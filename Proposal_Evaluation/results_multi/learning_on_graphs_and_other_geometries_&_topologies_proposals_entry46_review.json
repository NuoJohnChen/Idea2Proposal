    "Summary": "The proposal aims to extend deep learning to non-Euclidean domains by addressing limitations in expressive power, scalability, and generalization of GNNs. It proposes a three-part framework incorporating topological awareness, geometry-adaptive parametrization, and efficient training, with a detailed experiment plan to validate the approach. The proposal is grounded in differential geometry and topology, offering a novel integration of advanced mathematical tools to enhance GNN performance.",
