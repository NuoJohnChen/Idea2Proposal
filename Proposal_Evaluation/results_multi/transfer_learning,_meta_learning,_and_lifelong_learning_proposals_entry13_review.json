    "Summary": "The proposal seeks to unify transfer learning, meta-learning, and lifelong learning into a single framework for adaptive AI systems. It proposes a hierarchical memory-augmented architecture with modular neural networks, adaptive optimization, and scalable memory techniques. The experiments include synthetic tasks, cross-domain benchmarks, robotics simulations, and real-world healthcare deployment.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Ambitious and novel hypothesis aiming to unify three learning paradigms.",
        "Detailed and well-structured proposed method.",
        "Comprehensive experimental plan covering multiple domains and scenarios."
