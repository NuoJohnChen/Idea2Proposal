    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a tightly integrated neurosymbolic framework combining physics-informed learning with automated formal reasoning. It addresses limitations in current hybrid AI systems by proposing a bidirectional synergy between neural and symbolic components, with innovations in differentiable physics-informed symbolic layers, automated symbolic rule generation, and a bidirectional training protocol. The experiment plan includes validation, testing, benchmarking, scalability analysis, and ablation studies.",
