    "Summary": "The proposal aims to extend deep learning to non-Euclidean domains by integrating geometric and topological priors into neural networks. It addresses limitations of current GNNs in expressive power, scalability, and geometric awareness, proposing a unified framework with geometric embeddings, topological regularization, and higher-order graph networks. The experiment plan includes synthetic tasks, geometric benchmarking, topological learning, large-scale graphs, and ablation studies.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-motivated problem statement with strong grounding in recent literature.",
        "Innovative combination of geometric and topological priors.",
        "Comprehensive and thorough experiment plan.",
        "Strong theoretical foundation with references to recent work."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks detailed discussion on potential technical challenges (e.g., computational complexity of Riemannian optimization).",
        "Practical implementation details of differentiable topological layers are not fully explored.",
        "Risk of over-optimism in scalability claims without concrete mitigation strategies."
