    "Summary": "The proposal aims to integrate Bayesian methods with deep learning to improve scalability and robustness in probabilistic inference. It proposes a three-part approach: structured variational families, hybrid inference, and a novel UQ framework. The experimental plan includes benchmarking, hybrid inference evaluation, UQ validation, scaling to large models, and real-world deployment.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement highlighting limitations of existing methods.",
        "Strong motivation and hypothesis proposing a unified framework.",
        "Ambitious and intellectually deep approach combining multiple advanced techniques.",
        "Comprehensive experimental plan covering various aspects of the proposed method."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks detailed discussion on computational overhead and feasibility of hybrid inference.",
        "Limited risk mitigation strategies for potential technical challenges.",
        "Experimental plan could benefit from more detailed ablation studies.",
        "Scaling to large models is mentioned but not thoroughly addressed."
