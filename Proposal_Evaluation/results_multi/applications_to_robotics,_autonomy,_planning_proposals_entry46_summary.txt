Decision: Accept
Weaknesses: Lacks depth in discussing technical challenges, such as integrating discrete-continuous latent spaces with diffusion models., Insufficient discussion on computational overhead and real-time feasibility of uncertainty propagation., Validation plan could benefit from more critical analyses, such as failure mode exploration and robustness to sensor noise.
