    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a scalable neurosymbolic AI framework that integrates neural networks with symbolic reasoning and physics-informed constraints. It addresses the trade-off between scalability and interpretability in current AI systems, proposing a hybrid architecture with differentiable symbolic operations, physics-informed losses, and dynamic modular integration. The experiment plan includes validation, evaluation, benchmarking, scalability, and ablation studies.",
