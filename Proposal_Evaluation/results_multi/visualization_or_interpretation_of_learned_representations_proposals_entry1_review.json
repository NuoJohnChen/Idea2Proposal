    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a unified framework for interpretable neural representations by combining hierarchical feature visualization, causal intervention, and human-in-the-loop evaluation. It addresses the opacity of deep neural networks and proposes a hybrid approach to improve interpretability.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement.",
        "Strong motivation with a compelling hypothesis.",
        "Innovative integration of visualization, causal intervention, and human evaluation.",
        "Detailed and comprehensive experiment plan.",
        "Potential for significant impact in critical applications like healthcare."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Feasibility of integrating diffusion models with causal graphs is not fully discussed, and the technical challenges are understated.",
        "Scalability of human-in-the-loop evaluation could be a challenge, especially for large datasets.",
        "Limited discussion on computational costs and resource requirements for training diffusion models.",
        "Execution plan lacks detailed risk mitigation strategies for potential technical hurdles."

        "How will the human-in-the-loop evaluation be scaled to ensure statistical significance?",
        "What specific metrics will be used to quantify 'compositionality' and 'causal consistency'?"

    "Limitations": [
        "Integration of diffusion models with causal graphs may be technically challenging and computationally intensive.",
        "Human evaluations may not scale well for large datasets and could introduce subjectivity.",
        "Generalizability of the method to other domains beyond healthcare is not thoroughly discussed.",
