    "Summary": "The proposal introduces adaptive model-based priors (AMPs) to improve sample efficiency in reinforcement learning by dynamically weighting the influence of learned models based on local uncertainty and task relevance. The method includes uncertainty-aware model selection, hierarchical model ensembles, and adaptive policy optimization. The experiment plan covers validation, benchmarking, high-dimensional tasks, scalability, and theoretical analysis.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-motivated problem statement.",
        "Innovative hypothesis proposing dynamic model utilization.",
        "Detailed proposed method with three main components.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan covering various aspects of validation and evaluation."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks detailed discussion on computational overhead of hierarchical model ensembles.",
        "Feasibility of integrating AMPs into PPO and SAC is not thoroughly explored.",
        "Experimental plan does not clearly outline interpretation of results to validate core hypotheses.",
        "Theoretical analysis section is vague with no clear indication of how regret bounds will be derived or compared to prior work."
