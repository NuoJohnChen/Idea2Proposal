    "Summary": "The proposal aims to bridge autoregressive and diffusion-based generative models by introducing adaptive latent dynamics. It hypothesizes that learning input-dependent latent transitions can combine the strengths of both paradigms while mitigating their weaknesses. The proposed method includes dynamic latent scheduling, a unified training objective, and efficient sampling via latent compression. The experimental plan covers validation on synthetic data, benchmarking on image and text generation, efficiency quantification, and downstream transfer.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Novel and ambitious core idea addressing a significant gap in generative models.",
        "Comprehensive experimental plan covering multiple domains (synthetic data, images, text).",
        "Potential for high impact if successful, given the widespread use of generative models."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lack of detailed technical specifics on the implementation of the adaptive scheduler, especially the reinforcement learning component.",
        "Generic experimental plan without deep consideration of potential failure modes or alternative hypotheses.",
        "Limited discussion on computational overhead and training stability.",
        "No concrete baseline comparisons or ablation studies in the experiment plan."
