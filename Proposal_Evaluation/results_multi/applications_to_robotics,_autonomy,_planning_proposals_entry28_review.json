    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a hierarchical imitation learning framework for long-horizon robotic planning, leveraging latent subgoal discovery and diffusion-based policies. It aims to address scalability and adaptability issues in current methods like MBRL and MCTS. The approach includes subgoal discovery via VAEs, hierarchical diffusion policies, and online adaptation via MPC. The experiment plan covers validation, benchmarking, generalization, scalability, and ablations.",
