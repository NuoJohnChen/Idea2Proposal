    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a unified probabilistic inference framework for deep learning, addressing scalability, approximation bias, and integration challenges through adaptive SG-MCMC, hybrid VI-MCMC, and scalable UQ techniques. The experiment plan includes synthetic benchmarks, ablation studies, and real-world applications.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement identifying key gaps in current probabilistic inference techniques.",
        "Ambitious hypotheses proposing a unified framework combining multiple advanced techniques.",
        "Comprehensive experimental plan covering synthetic and real-world datasets.",
        "High intellectual depth and potential impact."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Feasibility and scalability claims may be overly optimistic, especially for large transformer models.",
        "Lacks detailed discussion of potential pitfalls and alternative approaches.",
        "Execution credibility could be strengthened with more detailed risk mitigation strategies."
