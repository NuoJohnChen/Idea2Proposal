Weaknesses: Limited discussion of computational feasibility for dynamic/large-scale graphs., Integration of spectral filters, attention, and differential geometry lacks technical detail., No explicit mention of baseline comparisons for cross-geometry generalization., Validation plan could benefit from more emphasis on failure modes and edge cases., Proposed method is ambitious but may face practical implementation hurdles.
