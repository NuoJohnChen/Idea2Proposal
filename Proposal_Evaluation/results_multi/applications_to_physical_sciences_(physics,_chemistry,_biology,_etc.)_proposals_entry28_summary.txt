Weaknesses: Limited discussion on the computational trade-offs between wavelet-based multiresolution and FNO efficiency., Unclear how adaptive sampling will balance exploration (rare events) vs. exploitation (model refinement) without excessive overhead., No explicit fallback strategy if physics-constrained training fails to converge.
