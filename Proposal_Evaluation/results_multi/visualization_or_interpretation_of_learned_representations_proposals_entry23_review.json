    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a framework for interpreting and visualizing learned features in deep neural networks (DNNs), aiming to improve interpretability and enable better diagnosis of model biases and failures. It combines hierarchical feature disentanglement, dynamic interaction graphs, and a unified visualization interface.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement.",
        "Strong motivation with a compelling hypothesis.",
        "Ambitious and comprehensive proposed method.",
        "Detailed and thorough experiment plan.",
        "Includes human-in-the-loop evaluation."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Feasibility concerns regarding dynamic interaction graphs.",
        "Lacks detailed discussion on computational challenges.",
        "Potential difficulty in generalizing across architectures."
