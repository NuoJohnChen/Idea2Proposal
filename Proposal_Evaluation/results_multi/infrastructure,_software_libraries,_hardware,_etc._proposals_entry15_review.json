    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a scalable infrastructure for distributed deep learning by optimizing communication and hardware utilization. It combines adaptive communication protocols, hardware-aware scheduling, and fault tolerance mechanisms to address bottlenecks in current frameworks. The experiment plan includes benchmarking, validation, and scalability testing on large-scale clusters.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Addresses a critical and timely problem in distributed deep learning.",
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement with relevant citations.",
        "Strong motivation and plausible hypothesis grounded in prior work.",
        "Detailed proposed method with three key components: adaptive communication, hardware-aware scheduling, and fault tolerance.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan with benchmarks, validation, and scalability testing."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Reinforcement learning-based policy optimization may introduce unpredictable overheads and convergence issues.",
        "Scalability claims for 1000+ node clusters lack empirical justification or simulation-based validation.",
        "Hardware-aware scheduling assumes ideal profiling accuracy, which may not hold in real-world heterogeneous environments."
