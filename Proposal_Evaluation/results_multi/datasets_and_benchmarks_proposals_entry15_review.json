    "Summary": "The proposal addresses critical flaws in ML benchmarks (data leakage, narrow task scope, misaligned metrics) via Dynamic Adversarial Data Collection (DADC), Task Compositionality, and Metric Robustness. Methods include leakage-free curation, dynamic benchmarking, and multi-dimensional evaluation. Experiments focus on contamination quantification, DADC validation, compositional generalization, metric alignment, and efficiency-accuracy tradeoffs.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement with documented limitations.",
        "Novel integration of DADC and procedural generation.",
        "Comprehensive validation plan with robustness scorecards.",
        "Strong alignment with recent research (e.g., Dynabench, ProcTHOR)."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Scalability of human-in-the-loop DADC is unclear.",
        "Limited discussion of annotator bias mitigation.",
        "Procedural tasks may lack real-world complexity.",
        "Computational costs of dynamic benchmarking are unspecified."
