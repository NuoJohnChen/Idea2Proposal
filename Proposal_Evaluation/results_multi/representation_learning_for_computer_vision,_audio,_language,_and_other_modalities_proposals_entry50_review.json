    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a unified representation learning framework across vision, audio, and language modalities, combining masked reconstruction, contrastive alignment, and modality-invariant regularization. The goal is to create a shared latent space for more robust and generalizable representations. The experiment plan includes single-modal pretraining, cross-modal alignment, joint multimodal pretraining, efficiency analysis, and generalization tests.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Ambitious and intellectually deep hypothesis proposing a shared latent space for multiple modalities.",
        "Clear problem statement highlighting the fragmentation in current modality-specific methods.",
        "Comprehensive experimental plan covering a wide range of evaluations."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks detailed discussion on potential technical challenges, such as computational complexity and feasibility of modality-agnostic representations.",
        "Execution plan is overly optimistic without concrete risk mitigation strategies.",
        "Validation plan lacks depth in addressing potential failure modes and robustness of the proposed method."

    "Questions": [
        "How will the proposed method handle the inherent differences in data structures across modalities (e.g., sequential vs. spatial data)?",
        "What are the specific computational resources required for joint training, and how will scalability be ensured?",
        "How will the method ensure that the shared latent space does not lose modality-specific nuances critical for downstream tasks?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "Potential high computational cost due to joint training across modalities.",
        "Risk of losing modality-specific features in the pursuit of a unified representation.",
        "Unclear how the method will perform in scenarios with highly imbalanced or missing modalities."
