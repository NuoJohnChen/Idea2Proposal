    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a multi-scale computational model of cognitive control by integrating spiking neural networks (SNNs) and dynamic network analysis, validated against human neuroimaging and electrophysiological data. The goal is to bridge the gap between theoretical models and empirical observations, with potential applications in understanding and treating cognitive control deficits in disorders like schizophrenia and ADHD.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-structured problem statement.",
        "Ambitious and original hypothesis integrating multi-scale neural dynamics.",
        "Detailed method with a three-part approach and step-by-step experiment plan.",
        "Potential for significant impact in neuroscience and clinical applications."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "High-risk integration of diverse methodologies (SNNs, fMRI, EEG, TMS) without detailed risk mitigation.",
        "Lack of discussion on technical challenges (e.g., model scalability, data integration).",
        "Overly optimistic validation plan given the complexity of the proposed work.",
        "Limited discussion on alternative approaches or potential pitfalls."

        "What are the specific technical challenges in combining SNNs with dynamic network analysis, and how will they be addressed?",
        "How scalable is the proposed model, and what are the computational resource requirements?",
        "What are the potential failure modes of the proposed TMS experiments, and how will they be mitigated?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "High complexity and ambitious scope may lead to unforeseen technical challenges.",
        "Integration of multi-scale data is non-trivial and may require significant computational resources.",
