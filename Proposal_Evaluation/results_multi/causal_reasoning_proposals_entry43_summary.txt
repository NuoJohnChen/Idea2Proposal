Weaknesses: Lacks detailed discussion on how the latent causal graph learning module will scale to high-dimensional data., Potential technical challenges in integrating differentiable causal discovery with neural networks are not fully addressed., Limited discussion on potential pitfalls and mitigation strategies in the experiment plan., The proposal could benefit from more concrete examples of how the framework will be applied to real-world high-dimensional data.
