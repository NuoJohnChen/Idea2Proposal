    "Summary": "The proposal introduces adaptive model-based priors (AMPs) to improve reinforcement learning efficiency by dynamically adjusting the influence of dynamics models based on their local accuracy and uncertainty. The method combines uncertainty-aware dynamics modeling, adaptive horizon control, and policy optimization with AMPs. The experiment plan includes validation, benchmarking, generalization, and ablation studies.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement highlighting the limitations of current RL methods.",
        "Well-grounded motivation and hypothesis based on recent literature.",
        "Detailed proposed method with three key components.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan covering multiple aspects of validation and testing."

    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lack of discussion on computational overhead and scalability issues.",
        "Potential feasibility concerns with the hybrid dynamics model.",
        "Limited discussion on practical implementation challenges."
