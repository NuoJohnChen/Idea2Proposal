    "Summary": "The proposal introduces Adaptive Hierarchical Momentum (AHM), a novel optimizer designed to handle non-stationary and sparse gradients through hierarchical adaptation, gradient decomposition, and entropy-based learning rate rescaling. The method aims to improve upon existing optimizers by addressing their limitations in dynamic and sparse environments. The experiment plan includes synthetic benchmarks, deep learning tasks, sparse data regimes, ablation studies, and theoretical analysis.",
