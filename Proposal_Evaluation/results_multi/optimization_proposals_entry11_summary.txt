Overall Quality: 7
Argumentative Cohesion: 8
Intellectual Depth: 9
Execution Credibility: 6
Scientific Rigor: 6
Decision: Reject
Weaknesses: Technical details on the meta-learner's architecture and training process are sparse, raising questions about implementation feasibility., Limited discussion on computational overhead and scalability, which could be critical for real-world adoption., Theoretical analysis is mentioned but lacks depth in justifying stability guarantees or regret bounds., Experiment plan, while broad, does not sufficiently address potential failure modes or robustness under extreme non-stationarity.
