    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a unified framework for ensuring fairness, safety, and privacy in AI systems, addressing limitations in current siloed approaches. It hypothesizes that dynamic fairness metrics, privacy-aware safety mechanisms, and cross-domain audits can mitigate trade-offs and improve societal alignment. The proposed method includes dynamic fairness metrics, privacy-safety synergy, and unified auditing, with a detailed experiment plan involving benchmarking, testing dynamic fairness, evaluating DP-RL, cross-domain audits, and longitudinal impact studies.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Addresses a critical and timely issue in AI systems with interdisciplinary rigor.",
        "Comprehensive problem statement highlighting gaps in current approaches.",
        "Structured and detailed experiment plan with clear milestones.",
        "Strong potential for societal impact if theoretical claims hold."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Technical feasibility of joint optimization lacks concrete validation.",
        "Over-reliance on hypothetical synergies (e.g., privacy-safety trade-offs).",
        "Limited risk analysis for deployment challenges in sensitive domains.",
        "Longitudinal study design may not capture emergent risks adequately."
