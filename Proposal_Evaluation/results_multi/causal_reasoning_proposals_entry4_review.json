    "Summary": "The proposal aims to bridge the gap between correlation and causation in neural networks by embedding causal invariants into architecture design. It introduces a three-part framework: Intervention-Aware Neural Causal Models (IANCM), Mechanistic Bottlenecking, and Counterfactual Latent Diffusion. The experiment plan includes synthetic benchmarking, OOD generalization, counterfactual image editing, real-world medical applications, and scalability analysis.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Ambitious and timely problem statement.",
        "Novel integration of causal principles into neural architectures.",
        "Comprehensive and technically detailed proposed method.",
        "Rigorous and multi-faceted experiment plan."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks detailed discussion on potential technical challenges (e.g., enforcing modularity via adversarial training).",
        "Limited discussion on computational overhead of diffusion models.",
        "Baseline comparisons could be more explicitly detailed.",
        "Potential failure modes are not thoroughly explored."

        "What are the specific adversarial training strategies to enforce modularity, and how will they scale with model size?",
        "How will the computational overhead of diffusion models be mitigated in large-scale applications?"

    "Limitations": [
        "Potential scalability issues with high-dimensional data.",
        "Risk of over-regularization when enforcing modularity.",
        "Computational cost of diffusion models may limit real-time applications."
