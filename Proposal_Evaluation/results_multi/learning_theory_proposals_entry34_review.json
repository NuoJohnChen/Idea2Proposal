    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a theoretical framework for adaptive learning dynamics in non-convex optimization, linking adaptive optimizers to directional curvature via stochastic differential equations (SDEs). It includes SDE modeling, geometric decomposition, and implicit bias analysis, with a detailed experiment plan covering synthetic benchmarks, neural network analysis, and generalization experiments.",
