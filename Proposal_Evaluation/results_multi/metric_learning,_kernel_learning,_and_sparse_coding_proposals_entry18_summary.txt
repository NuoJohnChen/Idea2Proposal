Weaknesses: Lacks detailed discussion of potential technical challenges in integrating diverse techniques., Scalability claims are not fully substantiated with respect to computational overhead., Interpretability aspect is somewhat vague and relies on user studies., Feasibility of integrating complex components into a single framework is questionable., Experimental plan could benefit from more critical analyses, such as exploring failure modes or boundary conditions.
