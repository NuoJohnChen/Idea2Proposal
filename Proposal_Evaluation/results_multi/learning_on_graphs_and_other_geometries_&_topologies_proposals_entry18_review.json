    "Summary": "The proposal aims to advance geometric deep learning by developing adaptive, geometry-aware architectures for non-Euclidean data. It addresses scalability, geometric bias, and generalization limitations in current graph neural networks through geometry-aware embeddings, adaptive message passing, and scalable graph transformers. The experiment plan includes synthetic tasks, benchmark datasets, scalability tests, downstream tasks, and theoretical analysis.",
