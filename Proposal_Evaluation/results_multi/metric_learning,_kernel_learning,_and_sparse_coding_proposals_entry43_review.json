    "Summary": "The proposal seeks to unify metric learning, kernel learning, and sparse coding into a joint framework to address scalability, robustness, and interpretability limitations. It proposes a metric-aware kernel, sparse kernel representations, and efficient optimization via stochastic block-coordinate descent. The experimental plan includes synthetic data validation, benchmarking on image and text datasets, noise robustness tests, computational efficiency analysis, and ablation studies.",
