    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a unified framework for interpretable neural representations by combining hierarchical feature visualization, semantic disentanglement via contrastive learning, and a novel human-evaluated interpretability metric. It aims to address the opacity of deep neural networks by providing scalable, human-interpretable visualizations without relying on labeled concept datasets.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement highlighting limitations of current methods.",
        "Innovative combination of contrastive learning and latent space factorization for disentanglement.",
        "Detailed and systematic experiment plan with benchmarks, validation, and ablation studies.",
        "Novel approach to quantifying interpretability through human evaluations, bypassing labeled datasets."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Feasibility of scaling to high-dimensional data is not thoroughly discussed.",
        "Potential subjectivity and biases in human evaluations are not addressed.",
        "Lack of discussion on computational resources required for the proposed methods.",
        "Unclear how the proposed metric will be standardized across different domains."

    "Limitations": [
        "Scalability to high-dimensional data may be limited by computational resources.",
        "Human evaluations may introduce subjectivity and variability in interpretability scores.",
        "The proposed metric may not generalize well across diverse domains without significant adaptation."
