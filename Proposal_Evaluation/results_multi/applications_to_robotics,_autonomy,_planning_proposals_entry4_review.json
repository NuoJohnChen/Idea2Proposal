    "Summary": "The proposal aims to enhance autonomous navigation by integrating hierarchical world models with uncertainty-aware learning. It addresses limitations in current systems, such as brittleness to uncertainty and lack of interpretability, by proposing a novel combination of hierarchical latent spaces and uncertainty propagation. The method extends latent dynamics models with Bayesian neural networks and develops a two-level planner using MCTS and MPPI. The experiment plan includes validation, benchmarking, real-world deployment, ablation studies, and generalization tests.",
