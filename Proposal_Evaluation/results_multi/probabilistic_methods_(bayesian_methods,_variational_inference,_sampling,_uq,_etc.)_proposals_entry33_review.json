    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a unified framework for scalable and robust probabilistic inference by integrating Bayesian methods with deep learning. It addresses challenges in scalability, computational efficiency, and uncertainty quantification through adaptive variational families, efficient SG-MCMC, and uncertainty-aware deep learning.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement highlighting limitations of current methods.",
        "Ambitious hypothesis proposing innovative integrations of Bayesian and deep learning techniques.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan covering benchmarks, validation, scalability, and ablation studies.",
        "Detailed proposed method with a three-part approach leveraging normalizing flows, adaptive preconditioning, and hybrid training."
