    "Summary": "The proposal aims to integrate neural and symbolic AI systems by developing a unified framework that enforces physical and logical constraints within neural architectures. It proposes three key innovations: physics-informed neural-symbolic layers, scalable neurosymbolic reasoning, and a unified training framework. The experiment plan includes validation on synthetic tasks, benchmarking, real-world applications, and ablation studies.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-motivated problem statement.",
        "Ambitious hypothesis with potential for significant impact.",
        "Detailed and comprehensive experiment plan.",
        "Strong scientific rigor with well-designed validation metrics."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Feasibility of some technical innovations (e.g., adaptive symbolic constraints, neural-guided MCTS) is not thoroughly discussed.",
        "Lacks detailed risk assessment and mitigation strategies.",
        "Intellectual depth may be overly ambitious given current field limitations."
