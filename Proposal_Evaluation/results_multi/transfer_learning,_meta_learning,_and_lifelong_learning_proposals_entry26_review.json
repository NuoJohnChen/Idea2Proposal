    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a unified framework for transfer, meta, and lifelong learning, addressing limitations in adaptability, catastrophic forgetting, and task generalization. It proposes a modular memory-augmented architecture with dynamic parameter composition and a unified optimization framework. The experiment plan includes cross-domain transfer, meta-learning scalability, lifelong learning stress tests, and real-world deployment.",
