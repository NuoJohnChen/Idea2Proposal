    "Summary": "The proposal aims to bridge the gap between theoretical machine learning guarantees and practical robustness by integrating theoretical extensions, uncertainty-aware learning, and adaptive meta-learning. It targets issues like distribution shifts, adversarial perturbations, and non-IID data, with a detailed experiment plan for validation.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-motivated problem statement with relevant citations.",
        "Ambitious and interdisciplinary approach combining theory and practice.",
        "Detailed experiment plan with well-defined benchmarks and metrics.",
        "Strong intellectual depth and potential for significant impact."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks specificity in integrating theoretical bounds with practical components.",
        "Limited discussion on scalability and computational challenges, especially for Bayesian methods.",
        "Real-world deployment plan is vague and may be overly optimistic.",
        "Insufficient discussion of potential failure modes and alternative approaches."

    "Questions": [
        "How will theoretical bounds (e.g., PAC-Bayes) be practically integrated into the meta-learning framework?",
        "What are the specific computational challenges and solutions for scaling Bayesian approximations?",
        "What alternative approaches will be considered if the primary methods fail?",
        "How will the meta-learning framework ensure stability in dynamic, real-world environments?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "Potential computational overhead in scaling Bayesian methods.",
        "Risk of theoretical bounds not translating into practical improvements.",
        "Integration of diverse components may introduce unforeseen complexities.",
        "Real-world deployment may face practical constraints (e.g., data privacy, latency)."
