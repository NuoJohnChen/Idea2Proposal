    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a dynamic multi-objective optimization framework to unify fairness, safety, and privacy in AI systems. It aims to develop unified metrics, adaptive optimization algorithms, and human-AI governance mechanisms to holistically address these trade-offs. The experiment plan includes benchmarking, validation, human-in-the-loop calibration, real-world deployment, and longitudinal impact study.",
