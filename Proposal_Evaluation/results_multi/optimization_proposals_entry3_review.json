    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a hybrid optimization method combining zeroth-order and first-order techniques for non-smooth objectives, featuring a dynamic switching mechanism based on local smoothness. It includes a smoothness classifier, adaptive zeroth-order kernels, and theoretical convergence guarantees. The experiment plan covers validation, benchmarking, ablation studies, and theoretical analysis.",
