    "Summary": "The proposal introduces Adaptive Model-Based Value Estimation (AMVE), a hybrid RL framework that dynamically interpolates between model-based and model-free value estimates. It aims to address the high sample complexity of model-free RL and the compounding errors in model-based RL by introducing uncertainty-guided model trust, error-propagating value targets, and joint optimization via a bi-level objective. The experiment plan includes validation on synthetic tasks, continuous control benchmarks, long-horizon tasks, high-dimensional observations, and real-world deployment.",
