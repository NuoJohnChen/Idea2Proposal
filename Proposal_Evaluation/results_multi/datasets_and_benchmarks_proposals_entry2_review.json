    "Summary": "The proposal aims to address biases and evaluation gaps in machine learning benchmarks by developing a rigorous, multi-dimensional benchmarking framework. It includes dataset auditing, dynamic benchmark design, and multi-dimensional evaluation to improve reliability and real-world applicability.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement with well-documented issues in current benchmarks.",
        "Comprehensive proposed method covering dataset auditing, dynamic benchmarks, and multi-dimensional evaluation.",
        "Detailed and credible experiment plan building on established methodologies.",
        "Strong motivation supported by recent literature."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Novelty of the approach could be questioned given prior work in this space.",
        "Lacks explicit discussion of challenges in implementing dynamic benchmarks and ensuring community adoption.",
        "Potential scalability issues with dynamic benchmarks over time."
