    "Summary": "The proposal introduces hierarchical state space models (HSSMs) combined with symbolic task decomposition to address long-horizon planning in robotics. It aims to improve efficiency and interpretability over traditional methods like MCTS, MPC, and deep RL. The method involves hierarchical state space design, symbolic task decomposition, and efficient online adaptation. The experiment plan includes synthetic benchmarks, simulation tests, real-world deployment, ablation studies, and efficiency benchmarks.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement highlighting limitations of current methods.",
        "Novel combination of HSSMs and symbolic task decomposition.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan covering various aspects of validation."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lack of technical depth in explaining how hierarchical transitions will be learned and integrated with symbolic planners.",
        "Overly optimistic real-world deployment plan without addressing potential challenges.",
        "Insufficient detail on baseline implementation and comparison.",
        "Limited discussion on potential failure modes and mitigation strategies."
