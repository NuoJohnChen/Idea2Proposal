    "Summary": "The proposal aims to enhance the interpretability of deep neural networks by combining topological data analysis (TDA) with sparse dictionary learning to visualize and disentangle learned features. It hypothesizes that this approach will yield semantically meaningful components that correlate with human-understandable concepts. The method includes topological feature extraction, sparse dictionary learning, and quantitative interpretability metrics, with a detailed experiment plan covering topology analysis, sparse decomposition validation, cross-architectural disentanglement, downstream interpretability, and efficiency benchmarking.",
