    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a unified representation space for vision, audio, and language by leveraging latent modality-invariant structures. It combines unified tokenization, a cross-modal transformer with gated attention, and hierarchical contrastive learning to address challenges like modality-specific biases and data imbalance.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Addresses a timely and important problem in multimodal AI.",
        "Intellectually compelling hypothesis about modality-invariant structures.",
        "Novel combination of advanced techniques (gated attention, hierarchical contrastive learning).",
        "Comprehensive experimental plan covering multiple benchmarks and ablation studies."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Technical challenges (e.g., stable training, modality alignment) are not deeply addressed.",
        "Computational costs of the proposed architecture are not discussed.",
        "Limited differentiation from existing frameworks (e.g., CLIP, Flamingo).",
        "Experimental plan lacks stress-testing of universality claims."

    "Questions": [
        "How will you ensure stable training with such a complex architecture?",
        "What specific advantages does your approach offer over existing multimodal frameworks like CLIP or Flamingo?",
        "How will you handle the inherent heterogeneity of modalities (e.g., differing temporal/spatial resolutions)?",
        "Have you considered the computational costs of scaling to multiple modalities?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "Potential instability in training due to the complexity of the proposed architecture.",
        "Risk of overfitting to specific modality pairs due to data imbalance.",
        "Scalability concerns with increasing modality count and sequence length.",
        "Limited generalizability to modalities not explicitly trained on."
