    "Summary": "The proposal introduces AdaCompose, a unified framework for continual adaptation across transfer learning, meta-learning, and lifelong learning. It addresses limitations like catastrophic forgetting, negative transfer, and scalability through dynamic parameter composition, task-relational hypernetworks, and a transformer-based memory system. The experiment plan includes evaluations on transfer efficiency, meta-learning scalability, lifelong learning stress tests, memory efficiency, and real-world deployment.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement identifying key limitations in existing paradigms.",
        "Ambitious hypothesis proposing a unified solution.",
        "Innovative combination of hypernetworks, meta-learning, and memory systems.",
