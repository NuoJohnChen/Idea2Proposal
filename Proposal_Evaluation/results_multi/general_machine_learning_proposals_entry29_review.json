    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a general-purpose learning model that dynamically adapts to multiple tasks using task-conditioned parameter generation and sparse activation. It addresses the limitations of current models in generalizing across diverse tasks and proposes a three-part framework for achieving this goal. The experiment plan includes synthetic tasks, benchmarking, efficiency analysis, ablation studies, and real-world deployment.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement.",
