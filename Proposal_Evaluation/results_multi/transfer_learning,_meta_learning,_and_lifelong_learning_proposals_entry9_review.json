    "Summary": "The proposal aims to unify transfer learning, meta-learning, and lifelong learning into a single adaptive learning system using a shared latent space with task-aware modulation, memory-augmented meta-optimization, and adaptive task routing. The experiment plan includes benchmarking, ablation studies, scaling, efficiency analysis, and real-world deployment.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Ambitious and well-articulated problem statement.",
        "Novel integration of multiple advanced techniques with potential for high impact.",
