    "Summary": "The proposal aims to redesign machine learning benchmarks to address limitations like dataset bias, static benchmarks, and insufficient edge case coverage. It proposes a dynamic benchmark architecture, difficulty-stratified evaluation, and multi-dimensional metrics, with a detailed experiment plan to validate the framework.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement",
        "Strong motivation and hypothesis",
        "Comprehensive proposed method with three interconnected components",
        "Detailed and logically structured experiment plan",
        "High scientific rigor with plans for meta-analysis and controlled studies"
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks specific technical details on dynamic benchmark implementation",
        "Feasibility concerns with dynamic updating and human-in-the-loop auditing",
        "Potential scalability issues with continuous data ingestion",
        "Subjectivity in human alignment scores not adequately addressed"
