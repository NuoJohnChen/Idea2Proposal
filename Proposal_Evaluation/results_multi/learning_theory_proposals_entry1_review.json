    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a theoretical framework for adaptive optimization methods in non-convex settings, linking adaptive dynamics to Hessian spectral properties. It includes spectral analysis, geometry-aware adaptivity, and convergence guarantees, with experiments spanning synthetic functions to large-scale deep learning tasks.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement.",
        "Novel and ambitious hypothesis linking adaptive methods to Hessian spectral properties.",
        "Comprehensive proposed method with three coherent components.",
