    "Summary": "The proposal aims to optimize distributed training infrastructure for large-scale AI models through a hardware-software co-design approach, addressing communication inefficiencies, memory management, and hardware underutilization. It proposes dynamic communication scheduling, hierarchical memory optimization, and accelerator-aware task partitioning, with a detailed experiment plan for validation.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement with recent literature citations.",
        "Detailed and comprehensive experiment plan, including benchmarking, evaluation, validation, scalability testing, and ablation studies.",
        "Strong scientific rigor with planned ablation studies and scalability testing.",
        "Novel combination of existing techniques to address identified challenges."
