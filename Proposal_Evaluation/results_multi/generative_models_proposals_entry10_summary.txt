Weaknesses: Feasibility of integrating symbolic memory buffers with neural components is uncertain due to potential architectural incompatibilities., Lacks discussion on how the model will handle noisy or ambiguous symbolic representations., Execution plan may underestimate the computational overhead of maintaining differentiable symbolic buffers., Scalability of the symbolic memory buffer is not tested beyond synthetic benchmarks.
