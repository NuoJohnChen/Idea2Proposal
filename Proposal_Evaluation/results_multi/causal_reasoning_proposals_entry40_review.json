    "Summary": "The proposal aims to bridge the gap between correlation and causation in neural networks by developing a hybrid architecture that combines structural causal models with neural components. It focuses on disentangling latent causal variables, learning intervention effects, and simulating counterfactuals. The experimental plan includes validation on synthetic data, intervention modeling, counterfactual reasoning, scaling to high-dimensional data, and real-world applications.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Addresses a significant and timely problem in AI.",
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement and motivation.",
        "Ambitious and intellectually deep hypothesis.",
        "Comprehensive experimental plan with multiple validation steps.",

    "Weaknesses": [
        "Feasibility concerns, especially in scaling to high-dimensional data.",
        "Lacks detailed discussion of potential technical challenges and risks.",
        "Experimental validation could be more rigorous, particularly in addressing failure modes.",
        "Real-world applications are mentioned but not deeply explored.",
