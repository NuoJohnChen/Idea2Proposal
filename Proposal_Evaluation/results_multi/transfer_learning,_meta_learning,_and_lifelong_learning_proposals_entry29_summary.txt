Overall Quality: 7
Argumentative Cohesion: 8
Intellectual Depth: 8
Execution Credibility: 6
Scientific Rigor: 7
Decision: Accept
Weaknesses: Lacks depth in discussing potential technical challenges (e.g., computational overhead, memory scalability)., Validation plan could benefit from more stress tests under extreme non-stationary conditions., Execution details are somewhat optimistic without addressing feasibility constraints.
