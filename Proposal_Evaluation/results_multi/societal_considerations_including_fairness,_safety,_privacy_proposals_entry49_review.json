    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a holistic framework for addressing fairness, safety, and privacy in AI systems through unified metric design, dynamic constraint adaptation, and an audit pipeline. It aims to optimize these objectives jointly, supported by a detailed experiment plan spanning benchmarking, validation, and real-world deployment.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Addresses a critical and timely issue in AI systems.",
        "Well-articulated problem statement and compelling hypothesis.",
        "Ambitious and comprehensive proposed method.",
        "Detailed experimental plan with multiple validation steps."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Dynamic constraint adaptation may struggle with real-world noise and non-stationary environments.",
        "Audit pipeline implementation lacks discussion of computational overhead and false-positive handling.",
        "Joint optimization of fairness, safety, and privacy could lead to unstable training dynamics.",
        "Longitudinal impact studies depend heavily on external partnerships, introducing uncertainty."

    "Questions": [
        "How will the dynamic adaptation mechanism handle non-stationary or adversarial input shifts?",
        "What safeguards prevent the audit pipeline from overwhelming human reviewers with false positives?",
        "Are there theoretical guarantees on convergence or Pareto-optimality for the joint loss function?",
        "How will the framework adapt if one objective (e.g., privacy) must be prioritized abruptly due to regulatory changes?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "High-dimensional trade-offs may require heuristic tuning in practice.",
        "Real-world deployment scalability is untested for high-throughput systems.",
        "Policymaker collaboration introduces non-technical dependencies."
