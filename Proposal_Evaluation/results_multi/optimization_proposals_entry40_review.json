    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a meta-learned adaptive optimization framework for non-stationary objectives, combining dynamic gradient statistics estimation, meta-learning, and implicit regularization. It aims to address the limitations of existing optimizers like Adam and SGD in dynamic environments, with a comprehensive experimental plan covering synthetic benchmarks, deep learning tasks, and large-scale language model pretraining.",
