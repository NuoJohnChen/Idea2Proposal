    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a unified framework for scalable, efficient, and robust probabilistic inference in deep learning by integrating dependency-aware VI, scalable SG-MCMC, and robust UQ. It targets limitations of current Bayesian methods in high-dimensional settings and aims to improve uncertainty quantification under distributional shifts and adversarial attacks.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement identifying key limitations of current probabilistic methods.",
        "Ambitious and well-structured hypothesis proposing a unified framework.",
        "Detailed experiment plan covering benchmarks, evaluations, and ablation studies.",
        "Rigorous validation plan with multiple metrics and comparisons to strong baselines."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks depth in addressing potential technical challenges (e.g., computational overhead of normalizing flows).",
        "Insufficient discussion of risks and trade-offs (e.g., scalability vs. theoretical guarantees).",
        "Validation plan could benefit from more critical analyses (e.g., failure modes under extreme OOD data)."

        "How does the proposed UQ framework compare to recent advances in Bayesian deep learning (e.g., SWAG, Laplace approximations)?",
        "What are the expected trade-offs between scalability and the quality of uncertainty estimates?"

    "Limitations": [
        "Potential high computational cost of normalizing flows in dependency-aware VI.",
        "Unclear convergence guarantees for hybrid SG-MCMC in complex, high-dimensional posteriors.",
        "Robustness of UQ under extreme OOD scenarios or strong adversarial attacks is not thoroughly discussed."
