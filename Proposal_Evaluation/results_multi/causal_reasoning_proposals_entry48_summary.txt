Weaknesses: Technical details on the variational framework and contrastive loss are sparse, making it hard to assess feasibility., Scalability to high-dimensional data is claimed but not substantiated with concrete strategies., Baseline comparisons in the experimental plan lack specificity (e.g., versions of PC algorithm or neural causal models).
