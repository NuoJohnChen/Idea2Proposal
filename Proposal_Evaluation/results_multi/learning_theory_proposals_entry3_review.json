    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a framework to unify empirical and theoretical learning in deep learning by developing a trajectory-dependent complexity measure. It hypothesizes a dynamic compression effect in finite-width networks and proposes a three-part framework to validate this measure through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement.",
        "Ambitious and novel hypothesis focusing on dynamic compression in finite-width networks.",
        "Comprehensive proposed method with a three-part framework.",
        "Detailed experiment plan covering validation across different architectures and optimization methods.",
        "Strong scientific rigor with a focus on rigorous testing and comparison to baselines."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lack of detailed technical specifics on deriving the complexity measure.",
        "Execution plan may face practical hurdles in implementation.",
        "Limited discussion on potential failure modes or alternative approaches.",
        "Feasibility of the proposed measure is uncertain, particularly in formalizing the dynamic compression effect."

        "How will the framework handle cases where optimization trajectories are highly erratic or do not exhibit the assumed dynamic compression?",
        "What are the expected bounds on the trajectory-dependent complexity measure, and how will they compare to existing measures?"

    "Limitations": [
        "Potential difficulty in deriving a tractable trajectory-dependent complexity measure.",
        "Computational overhead in tracking optimization trajectories for large networks.",
        "Limited applicability to architectures or optimization methods not covered in the proposal.",
