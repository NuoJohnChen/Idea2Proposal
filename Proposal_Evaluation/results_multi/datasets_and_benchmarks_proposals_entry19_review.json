    "Summary": "The proposal aims to address dataset bias and evaluation gaps in machine learning benchmarks by introducing a three-part framework: bias-aware dataset construction, dynamic evaluation protocols, and generalization-centric metrics. The goal is to create more reliable benchmarks that better reflect real-world generalization.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement with relevant citations.",
        "Strong motivation and hypothesis that dynamic, diversity-aware benchmarks can improve model robustness.",
        "Comprehensive proposed method covering dataset construction, evaluation protocols, and metrics.",
        "Plans for meta-analyses and human-in-the-loop validation demonstrate scientific rigor."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lack of specificity in synthetic data generation techniques and scalability of the dynamic evaluation platform.",
        "Feasibility of large-scale human evaluations is uncertain.",
        "Execution plan could benefit from more concrete details on risk mitigation."
