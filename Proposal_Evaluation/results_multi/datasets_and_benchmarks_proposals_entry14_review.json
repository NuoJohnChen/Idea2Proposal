    "Summary": "The proposal aims to address the limitations of current machine learning benchmarks by introducing a framework that incorporates dynamic task generation, bias-aware dataset auditing, and cross-modal evaluation. The goal is to create more robust, fair, and scalable benchmarks that better reflect real-world scenarios.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Well-articulated problem statement backed by relevant literature.",
        "Strong motivation highlighting the need for dynamic and bias-aware benchmarks.",
        "Comprehensive proposed method with a three-pronged approach.",
        "Detailed and logically structured experiment plan."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks specific details on the implementation of dynamic task synthesis.",
        "Bias mitigation strategies need more validation details.",
        "Execution plan could benefit from more granularity to ensure feasibility."
