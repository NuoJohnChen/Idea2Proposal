    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a dynamical systems perspective on SGD to bridge the gap between empirical and theoretical learning in deep neural networks. It hypothesizes that the stability of SGD's trajectory and the geometry of data manifolds are key to understanding generalization. The proposed method includes dynamical analysis of SGD, data-dependent generalization bounds, and empirical validation via synthetic and real-world tasks.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Ambitious and original hypothesis integrating dynamical systems, statistical mechanics, and optimization theory.",
        "Clear problem statement highlighting limitations of existing theoretical frameworks.",
        "Detailed experiment plan with synthetic and real-world tasks.",
        "Potential to significantly advance theoretical understanding of deep learning."

    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks detailed discussion of technical challenges (e.g., computational complexity of estimating Lyapunov exponents).",
        "Feasibility of deriving non-vacuous bounds is not thoroughly addressed.",
        "Validation plan could benefit from more explicit discussion of baseline comparisons and potential failure modes.",
        "Risk analysis and mitigation strategies are underdeveloped."
