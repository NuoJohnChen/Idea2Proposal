Weaknesses: Lacks detailed discussion on convergence guarantees for the joint optimization framework., Feasibility of integrating complex components into a unified framework is uncertain, with no clear fallback plan if integration fails., Validation plan could benefit from stress tests to expose failure modes (e.g., adversarial inputs or distribution shifts)., Potential computational bottlenecks in the joint optimization are not quantified.
