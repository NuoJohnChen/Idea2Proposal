    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a unified geometric deep learning framework for non-Euclidean data (graphs, manifolds, cellular complexes) using gauge-equivariant kernels, sheaf neural networks, and persistent homology. It targets limitations in generalization, higher-order interactions, and theoretical guarantees of current methods.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear identification of gaps in current methods",
        "Ambitious integration of advanced mathematical tools (gauge theory, sheaves, topology)",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan covering synthetic and real-world benchmarks",
        "Strong theoretical grounding with recent literature"
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Implementation challenges of integrating diverse mathematical tools may be underestimated",
        "Lack of discussion on potential failure modes or scenarios where the unified framework underperforms",
        "Unclear efficiency of the proposed topological attention mechanism",
        "Limited discussion of computational complexity for higher-order complexes"

    "Questions": [
        "How will you handle cases where the unified framework performs worse than domain-specific methods?",
        "What are the computational complexity bounds for your proposed topological attention mechanism?",
        "Have you identified any fundamental trade-offs between generality and performance in your framework?",
        "How will the computational complexity of persistent homology be managed in large-scale graphs?",
        "What are the fallback strategies if the integration of sheaf Laplacians proves infeasible?"

    "Limitations": [
        "Potential computational overhead from integrating multiple geometric paradigms",
        "Risk of theoretical elegance overshadowing practical performance",
        "Challenges in scaling to very large graphs/high-resolution manifolds simultaneously",
