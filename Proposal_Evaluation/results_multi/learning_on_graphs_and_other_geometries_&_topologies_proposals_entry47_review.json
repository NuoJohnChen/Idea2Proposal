    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a geometry-aware deep learning framework to bridge the gap between Euclidean and non-Euclidean domains, addressing limitations in current GNNs. It integrates differential geometry tools with adaptive message-passing mechanisms, including geometry-aware message passing, dynamic topology adaptation, and a unified optimization framework. The experimental plan covers synthetic benchmarking, real-world graph tasks, ablation studies, cross-geometry generalization, and efficiency analysis.",
