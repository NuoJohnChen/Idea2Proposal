Decision: Accept
Weaknesses: Lack of detailed technical solutions for potential challenges (e.g., modality alignment, computational complexity)., Ambition may exceed feasibility given the current state of multimodal research., Limited discussion of failure modes or edge cases in the experimental plan., Modality dropout, while promising, lacks empirical validation in this context.
