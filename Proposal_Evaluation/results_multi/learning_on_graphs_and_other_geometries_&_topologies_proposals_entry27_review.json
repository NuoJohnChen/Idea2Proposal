    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a topology-aware learning framework to unify deep learning across Euclidean and non-Euclidean domains. It addresses limitations in current geometric deep learning methods by dynamically adapting to local and global geometric properties, unifying embeddings, and ensuring scalability.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement.",
        "Ambitious and original hypothesis aiming to unify diverse geometries.",
        "Technically detailed proposed method with curvature-sensitive attention and unified embeddings.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan covering synthetic and real-world graphs, scalability, and ablation studies."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Feasibility of unifying diverse geometries into a single framework is highly ambitious and may face significant technical challenges.",
        "Lacks discussion on potential pitfalls or alternative approaches if the unified framework fails to generalize.",
        "Execution credibility could be questioned due to the ambitious scope."

    "Questions": [
        "What are the potential failure modes of the unified framework, and how would you address them?",
        "How do you plan to handle cases where the local and global geometric properties conflict?",
        "What are the computational overheads of the proposed curvature-sensitive attention mechanism?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "The unified framework may not generalize well across all types of geometries.",
        "Scalability to billion-edge graphs may be limited by memory and computational constraints.",
        "The proposed method may introduce additional complexity, making it harder to interpret."
