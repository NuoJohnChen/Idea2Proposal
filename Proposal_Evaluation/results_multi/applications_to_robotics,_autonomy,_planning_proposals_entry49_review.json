    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a hybrid hierarchical planning framework for autonomous robots, combining uncertainty-aware neural models with adaptive hierarchical abstraction to improve adaptability and robustness in dynamic environments. The method includes uncertainty-aware dynamics prediction, adaptive hierarchical abstraction, and real-time execution with fallbacks. The experiment plan covers predictive model validation, planner benchmarking, real-world deployment, scalability analysis, and ablation studies.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement identifying gaps in current methods.",
        "Plausible hypothesis integrating predictive models with hierarchical planning.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan covering validation, benchmarking, real-world deployment, and scalability.",
        "Well-structured proposal with logical flow from problem to solution."

    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks depth in addressing computational overhead of MCTS with neural models.",
        "Uncertainty quantification reliability in real-world scenarios needs stronger justification.",
        "Baseline comparisons could be more rigorous (e.g., inclusion of state-of-the-art hybrid planners).",
        "Incremental advancement over existing hybrid approaches, lacking paradigm-shifting novelty."
