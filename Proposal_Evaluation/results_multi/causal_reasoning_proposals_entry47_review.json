    "Summary": "The proposal aims to bridge the gap between statistical learning and true causal reasoning in AI by developing a hybrid architecture that integrates causal structure learning directly into neural networks. It proposes neural causal discovery with adaptive sparsity, counterfactual reasoning via latent interventions, and scalable training with causal regularization. The experimental plan includes validation on synthetic benchmarks, OOD generalization, real-world benchmarks, and high-dimensional domains.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Addresses a significant and timely problem in AI.",
        "Ambitious hypothesis with potential for high impact.",
        "Detailed and innovative proposed method.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan covering multiple domains."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Feasibility concerns about integrating causal discovery into neural networks at scale.",
        "Computational complexity of counterfactual reasoning may be prohibitive.",
        "Over-reliance on synthetic benchmarks for validation.",
        "Lack of detailed discussion on handling unobserved confounders in real-world data."

    "Limitations": [
        "Potential scalability issues with high-dimensional data.",
