    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a hybrid optimization framework that adaptively switches between zeroth- and first-order methods for high-dimensional non-convex problems. It addresses the limitations of current methods by proposing an uncertainty-aware switching criterion, memory-efficient zeroth-order integration, and bidirectional synergy between gradient and zeroth-order updates. The experiment plan includes synthetic benchmarking, black-box optimization tasks, adversarial robustness testing, and theoretical analysis.",
