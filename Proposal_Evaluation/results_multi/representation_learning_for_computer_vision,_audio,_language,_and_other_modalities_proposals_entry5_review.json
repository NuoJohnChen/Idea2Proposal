    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a unified multimodal representation learning framework using a shared transformer-based architecture with modality-specific adapters and dynamic routing. It combines intra-modal and cross-modal SSL objectives to improve cross-modal generalization and zero-shot transfer. The experiment plan includes validation, generalization, benchmarking, and scalability tests.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement highlighting limitations of current modality-specific approaches.",
        "Ambitious hypothesis proposing a novel modality-agnostic SSL framework.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan covering validation, generalization, benchmarking, and scalability.",
        "Builds on established techniques while introducing innovative elements like dynamic routing."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks detailed discussion on potential technical challenges (e.g., modality imbalance, computational costs).",
        "Feasibility concerns about scaling to 1B parameters and dynamic routing.",
        "Missing ethical considerations (e.g., bias in multimodal data).",
        "Execution details could be more grounded with risk mitigation strategies."

    "Limitations": [
        "Scalability to 1B parameters may be computationally prohibitive.",
        "Dynamic routing may introduce instability during training.",
        "Generalization to unseen tasks is not guaranteed and may require additional fine-tuning.",
