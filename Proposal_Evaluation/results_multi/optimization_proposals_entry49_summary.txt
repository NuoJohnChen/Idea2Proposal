Weaknesses: Insufficient discussion on computational overhead of GCS and LSTM controller., Scalability to large-scale models (e.g., transformers) is uncertain., Baseline comparisons lack recent optimizers (e.g., RAdam, Lookahead)., Potential failure modes of GCS (e.g., noise sensitivity) are underexplored.
