    "Summary": "The proposal introduces Adaptive Momentum with Dynamic Reweighting (AMDR), a new class of optimizers designed for non-stationary objectives in deep learning. It dynamically reweights historical gradient information based on gradient alignment and variance, addressing limitations of current optimizers. The method is evaluated through synthetic tasks, meta-learning benchmarks, continual learning, and large-scale language model pretraining.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and compelling problem statement addressing a relevant issue in deep learning.",
        "Novel hypothesis challenging the fixed EMA assumption in current optimizers.",
        "Detailed and comprehensive experiment plan covering various non-stationary scenarios.",
        "Potential for significant impact in fields like meta-learning, continual learning, and RL."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Technical challenges in implementing gradient alignment-based momentum and variance-aware learning rates are not fully explored.",
        "Limited discussion on potential failure modes and limitations of the method.",
        "Memory-efficient implementation details are somewhat vague.",
        "Lacks detailed theoretical analysis or guarantees for the proposed method."

    "Questions": [
        "How will the proposed method handle cases where gradient alignment is noisy or unreliable?",
        "What are the computational overheads of maintaining running statistics for dynamic reweighting?",
        "Are there any theoretical guarantees or bounds on the performance of AMDR?",
        "How robust is the sliding window approximation in scenarios with highly noisy gradients?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "The method may introduce additional hyperparameters (e.g., decay rate functions) that need tuning.",
        "Performance in highly noisy or adversarial non-stationary environments is untested.",
        "Scalability to very large models (e.g., billion-parameter transformers) is unclear.",
        "The dynamic reweighting approach may not generalize well to all types of non-stationarity."
