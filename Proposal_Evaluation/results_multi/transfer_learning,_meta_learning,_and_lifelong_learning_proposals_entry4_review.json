    "Summary": "The proposal seeks to unify transfer, meta, and lifelong learning into a single framework, addressing their individual limitations through a shared representation space balancing stability and plasticity. The method combines meta-learned initialization, sparse updates, and a unified transformer-based architecture. The experiment plan includes benchmarking, sparse update evaluation, end-to-end testing, and ablations.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement highlighting fragmentation in current approaches.",
        "Ambitious hypothesis proposing a shared representation space.",
        "Innovative combination of meta-learned initialization, sparse updates, and unified architecture.",
        "Detailed experiment plan with multiple benchmarks and ablation studies."
