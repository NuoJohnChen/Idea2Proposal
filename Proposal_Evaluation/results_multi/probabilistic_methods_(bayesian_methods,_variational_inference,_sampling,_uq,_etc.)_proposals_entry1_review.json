    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a hybrid framework for scalable and robust probabilistic inference by combining adaptive variational families, scalable sampling (SG-MCMC), and uncertainty-aware deep learning. It addresses the limitations of current Bayesian methods in scalability and accuracy, particularly in high-dimensional settings.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement.",
        "Strong motivation and hypothesis, linking Bayesian methods and deep learning.",
        "Ambitious and intellectually deep proposal, leveraging recent advances in VI, SG-MCMC, and UQ.",
        "Comprehensive experimental plan with multiple evaluation metrics."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks detailed discussion on potential technical challenges (e.g., computational overhead of hybrid methods).",
        "Execution plan is somewhat optimistic, with insufficient detail on how scalability to high-dimensional data will be achieved.",
        "Baseline comparisons and ablation studies could be more detailed to ensure scientific rigor."

    "Questions": [
        "How will the computational overhead of the hybrid VI-SG-MCMC method be managed, especially for large-scale datasets?",
        "What are the specific trade-offs between adaptive variational families and fixed families in terms of computational efficiency and approximation quality?",
        "How will the proposed framework handle extremely high-dimensional latent spaces, such as those in genomics or large-scale image datasets?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "Potential computational overhead of hybrid methods may limit scalability.",
        "Feasibility of scaling to high-dimensional data is not fully addressed.",
        "The proposed framework may require significant tuning and optimization to achieve practical performance."
