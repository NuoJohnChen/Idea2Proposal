    "Summary": "The proposal aims to enhance exploration in reinforcement learning by integrating latent world models with uncertainty-aware intrinsic rewards. It addresses sample inefficiency and distraction issues in current methods, proposing a framework that combines probabilistic world models, ensemble-based uncertainty quantification, and hybrid intrinsic rewards. The experiment plan includes validation on sparse-reward benchmarks, ablation studies, scaling tests, and real-world deployment.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement identifying key limitations of existing methods.",
        "Well-motivated hypothesis integrating latent world models and uncertainty quantification.",
        "Detailed and credible proposed method leveraging established techniques.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan covering validation, ablation, scaling, and real-world transfer."

    "Weaknesses": [
        "Novelty is clever but may not be paradigm-shifting.",
        "Limited discussion of potential pitfalls in scaling or real-world deployment.",
        "Dynamic adjustment of reward weights via meta-learning is ambitious but lacks detail on feasibility."
