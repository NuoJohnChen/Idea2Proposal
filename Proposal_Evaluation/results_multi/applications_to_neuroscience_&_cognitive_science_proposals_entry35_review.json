    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a unified framework for cognitive control by integrating computational models (predictive coding and dynamic gating) with neurobiological evidence across fMRI, electrophysiology, and pharmacological studies. The hypothesis centers on hierarchical interactions between PFC and subcortical structures, with validation planned through synthetic tasks, fMRI, primate electrophysiology, and human pharmacological studies.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Cohesive and persuasive narrative linking problem statement to hypothesis and method.",
        "Ambitious and original hypothesis combining predictive coding and dynamic gating, addressing a critical gap in the field.",
        "Comprehensive validation plan involving multiple methodologies, including a well-designed pharmacological study.",
        "Strong scientific rigor with planned empirical comparisons and pharmacological studies.",
        "Potential to significantly advance the integration of computational and neurobiological approaches."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Feasibility concerns due to the ambitious scope of integrating diverse data types, particularly in parameter tuning across modalities.",
        "Lack of detailed discussion on technical challenges in model integration and empirical alignment (e.g., handling noise in fMRI data).",
        "Potential over-reliance on collaboration with primate labs for electrophysiology data.",
        "Limited discussion of alternative hypotheses or model failure modes."
