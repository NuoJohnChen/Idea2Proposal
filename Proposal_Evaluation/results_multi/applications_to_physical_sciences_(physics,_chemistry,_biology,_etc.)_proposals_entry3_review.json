    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a hybrid neural operator architecture for accelerating multiscale physical simulations by combining multiscale decomposition, scale-adaptive processing, and attention-based fusion. It aims to address limitations in current methods for handling spatially varying scales and nonlinearities, with applications in fluid dynamics, molecular systems, and materials science. The experiment plan includes benchmarking on canonical PDEs, validation on multiscale systems, ablation studies, and real-world applications.",
