Weaknesses: Feasibility of scaling to modern architectures like Vision Transformers is not thoroughly discussed., Potential technical challenges in dynamic feature graph construction are not addressed in depth., Lack of discussion on computational resources required for large-scale experiments., Potential biases in human-annotated concepts and their impact on the Concept Alignment Score are not addressed., Generalizability of metrics across different architectures is uncertain.
