    "Summary": "The proposal aims to bridge the gap between correlation and causation in neural networks by developing a hybrid architecture that combines differentiable causal discovery, intervention-aware training, and counterfactual consistency loss. The method is evaluated on synthetic benchmarks, real-world high-dimensional data, and compared against state-of-the-art models.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement.",
        "Strong motivation with references to relevant literature.",
        "Ambitious and novel proposed method combining multiple advanced techniques.",
        "Detailed and comprehensive experiment plan, including synthetic benchmarks, real-world applications, and ablation studies."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Scalability of differentiable causal discovery to high-dimensional data (e.g., 10,000 nodes) is unproven and may require impractical computational resources.",
        "Limited discussion on how counterfactual data augmentation will be validated for correctness, especially in real-world applications.",
        "No concrete plan for handling cases where the causal structure is partially unknown or misspecified."

    "Questions": [
        "What computational resources (e.g., GPU memory, training time) are required for scaling to 10,000-node graphs?",
        "How will the method ensure that counterfactual perturbations generate plausible and meaningful variations?",
        "What fallback strategies exist if the learned causal graphs are unreliable or misspecified?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "Scalability to very large graphs may be limited by memory and optimization challenges.",
        "Counterfactual generation relies on learned causal graphs, which may introduce compounding errors.",
        "Generalizability to domains with incomplete or noisy causal knowledge is uncertain."
