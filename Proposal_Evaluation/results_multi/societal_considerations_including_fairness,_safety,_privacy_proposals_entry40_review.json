    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a unified framework to jointly optimize fairness, safety, and privacy in AI systems through unified metric design, adaptive constraint optimization, and context-aware deployment. The experiment plan includes benchmarking, human studies, optimization testing, deployment audits, and a longitudinal impact study.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Timely and critical problem statement with clear societal impact.",
        "Compelling hypothesis on the interdependence of fairness, safety, and privacy.",
        "Ambitious and comprehensive three-part framework.",
        "Detailed experiment plan with multiple validation steps."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks depth in discussing technical challenges and risks.",
        "Execution details for adaptive constraint optimization and deployment are vague.",
        "Validation plan could more explicitly discuss baselines and potential pitfalls.",
        "Feasibility concerns about longitudinal studies and real-world deployment audits."
