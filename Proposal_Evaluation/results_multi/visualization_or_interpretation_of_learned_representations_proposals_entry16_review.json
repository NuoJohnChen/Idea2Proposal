    "Summary": "The proposal aims to improve the interpretability of deep neural networks by developing a hybrid framework that combines concept-based disentanglement, dynamic feature attribution, and a unified visualization tool. The method targets scalability across architectures like Vision Transformers and large language models, with a detailed experiment plan including validation, benchmarking, scaling, user studies, and ablation studies.",
