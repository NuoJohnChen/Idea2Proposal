    "Summary": "The proposal aims to improve machine learning robustness to distribution shifts by combining self-supervised invariant representation learning, adversarial spurious feature suppression, and dynamic distributional robustness. It targets out-of-distribution generalization without requiring target domain data, with validation planned on synthetic and real-world benchmarks.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Addresses a critical and timely problem in machine learning.",
        "Clear problem statement with strong motivation from recent literature.",
        "Ambitious and novel combination of advanced techniques (self-supervised learning, adversarial training, DRO).",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan covering synthetic and real-world benchmarks, ablation studies, and theoretical analysis."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks detailed technical specifics in the proposed method (e.g., adversarial module integration, dynamic DRO implementation).",
        "Scalability and computational costs are not thoroughly addressed, especially for high-dimensional data.",
        "Over-reliance on the assumption that causal features can be reliably identified and separated.",
        "Theoretical analysis is mentioned but not detailed, leaving gaps in understanding generalization guarantees."

    "Questions": [
        "How exactly will the adversarial module be integrated into the training process to identify spurious features without target domain data?",
        "What are the computational limits of the proposed method, especially for high-dimensional data (e.g., video)?",
        "How will the method handle cases where causal assumptions are violated or causal features are not easily separable?",
        "Can the dynamic reweighting strategy converge reliably in practice, or are there risks of instability?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "Potential high computational cost due to adversarial training and dynamic DRO.",
        "Reliance on synthetic benchmarks may not fully capture real-world distribution shifts.",
        "Theoretical guarantees rely on strong causal assumptions, which may not hold in all scenarios.",
        "Dynamic reweighting could introduce training instability or bias towards noisy 'hard' examples."
