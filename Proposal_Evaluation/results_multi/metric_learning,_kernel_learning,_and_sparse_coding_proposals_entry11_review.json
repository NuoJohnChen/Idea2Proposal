    "Summary": "The proposal aims to unify metric learning, kernel learning, and sparse coding into a single framework to address scalability, adaptability, and interpretability issues. It proposes a joint optimization framework with kernelized metric learning, efficient optimization via Nystr\u00f6m approximation, and adaptive dictionary learning. The experiment plan includes synthetic data validation, benchmarking, scalability testing, ablation studies, and downstream task evaluation.",
