    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a unified framework for neurosymbolic AI, integrating physics-informed learning with formal reasoning to address limitations in current hybrid systems. It proposes a three-part approach: physics-informed neural-symbolic training, scalable neurosymbolic reasoning, and conflict resolution and stability. The experimental plan includes validation of symbolic grounding, evaluation of hybrid reasoning, testing in dynamic environments, benchmarking computational efficiency, and ablation studies.",
