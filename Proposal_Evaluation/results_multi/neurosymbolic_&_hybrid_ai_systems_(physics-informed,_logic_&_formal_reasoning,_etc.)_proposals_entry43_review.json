    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a neurosymbolic AI framework that integrates physics-informed learning with formal reasoning to address limitations in current AI systems. It hypothesizes that a tightly coupled architecture can achieve better generalization, interpretability, and sample efficiency. The proposed method includes a hybrid architecture with differentiable logic engines and physics-guided latent spaces, a joint optimization strategy, and scalability solutions. The experiment plan covers synthetic benchmarking, physics-informed learning, and neurosymbolic integration.",
