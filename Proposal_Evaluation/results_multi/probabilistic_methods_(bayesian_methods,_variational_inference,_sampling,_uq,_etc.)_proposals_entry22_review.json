    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a hybrid framework combining expressive variational inference, adaptive stochastic gradient MCMC, and uncertainty-aware deep architectures to address scalability and robustness issues in probabilistic inference for deep learning. It proposes a detailed experiment plan covering benchmarks, evaluations, and scalability tests.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement.",
        "Ambitious hypothesis proposing a hybrid framework.",
        "Comprehensive and detailed experiment plan.",
        "Rigorous validation metrics including ablation studies."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks depth in addressing potential technical challenges (e.g., computational overhead of flow-based VI).",
        "Limited discussion on convergence guarantees for adaptive SG-MCMC.",
        "Validation plan could benefit from more stress tests on adversarial scenarios or extreme data conditions.",
        "Underestimates the complexity of integrating UQ into deep architectures."
