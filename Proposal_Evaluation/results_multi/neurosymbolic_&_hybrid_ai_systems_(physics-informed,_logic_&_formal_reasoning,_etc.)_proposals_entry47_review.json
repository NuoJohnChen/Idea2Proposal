    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a neurosymbolic AI framework integrating physics-informed neural networks with formal reasoning for robust and interpretable models. It addresses limitations of current AI systems by proposing a hybrid architecture combining data-driven learning with symbolic constraints. The method includes physics-informed neural-symbolic layers, dynamic logic-based reasoning, and unified training via differentiable logic. The experiment plan covers benchmark tasks, symbolic integration validation, scientific workflows, interpretability assessment, and scaling to complex systems.",
