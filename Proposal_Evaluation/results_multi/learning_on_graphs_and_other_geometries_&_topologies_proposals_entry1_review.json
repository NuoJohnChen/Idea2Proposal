    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a geometry-adaptive framework for deep learning across Euclidean and non-Euclidean domains, combining spectral graph theory, attention mechanisms, and differential geometry to address limitations of current GNNs (e.g., over-smoothing, scalability). The method includes geometry-aware message passing, hierarchical pooling, and unified embedding spaces. Experiments span synthetic benchmarks, real-world tasks, scalability, and cross-geometry generalization.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-motivated problem statement highlighting limitations of current GNNs.",
        "Ambitious and theoretically grounded hypothesis leveraging geometric priors.",
        "Innovative combination of spectral methods, attention mechanisms, and differential geometry.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan with synthetic and real-world benchmarks, dynamic graphs, and cross-geometry generalization.",
        "Includes ablation studies to isolate contributions of key components."
