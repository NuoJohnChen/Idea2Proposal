    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a theoretical framework for adaptive learning dynamics (ALD) in non-convex optimization, aiming to unify and explain the success of existing optimization heuristics. It hypothesizes that ALD can provably escape saddle points faster and achieve better generalization by exploiting trajectory-dependent curvature information. The proposed method includes formalizing ALD, proving accelerated saddle-point escape, and designing a practical ALD optimizer. The experiment plan involves theoretical analysis, benchmarking on deep learning tasks, generalization and robustness tests, scaling laws, and ablation studies.",
