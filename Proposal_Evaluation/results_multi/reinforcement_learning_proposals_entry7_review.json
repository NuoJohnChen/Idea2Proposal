    "Summary": "The proposal introduces Adaptive Model-Based Priors (AMBP), a novel framework for improving sample efficiency in reinforcement learning by dynamically adjusting the reliance on model-based predictions based on uncertainty estimates. The method integrates uncertainty-aware model rollouts, dynamic horizon adaptation, and adaptive blending. The experiment plan includes validation of uncertainty estimation, testing dynamic horizon adaptation, benchmarking sample efficiency, ablation studies, and real-world feasibility testing.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-motivated problem statement.",
        "Innovative integration of multiple components (uncertainty-aware rollouts, dynamic horizon adaptation, adaptive blending).",
        "Comprehensive and rigorous experiment plan.",
        "Strong grounding in recent literature."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks detailed discussion on computational overhead and potential mitigation strategies.",
        "Specific metrics for evaluating the adaptive blending mechanism could be more explicitly defined.",
        "Potential technical challenges in real-world deployment are not fully explored."
