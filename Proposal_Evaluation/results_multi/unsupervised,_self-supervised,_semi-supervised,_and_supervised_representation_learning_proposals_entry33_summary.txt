Execution Credibility: 6
Scientific Rigor: 7
Decision: Accept
Weaknesses: Lacks detailed discussion of technical challenges (e.g., gradient interference, computational overhead)., Risks (e.g., overfitting due to dynamic weighting) are not thoroughly addressed., Validation plan could include more stress tests (e.g., adversarial robustness, out-of-distribution generalization)., Execution feasibility is somewhat optimistic without concrete solutions to anticipated challenges.
