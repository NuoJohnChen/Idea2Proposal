    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a unified multimodal representation learning framework using a transformer-based architecture with modality-agnostic objectives and cross-modal self-supervision. It aims to bridge vision, audio, and language modalities by leveraging shared latent spaces and dynamic modality adaptation. The experiment plan includes validation, cross-modal generalization, scalability testing, and benchmarking against state-of-the-art models.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement highlighting limitations of current multimodal approaches.",
        "Ambitious hypothesis proposing a unified framework for multiple modalities.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan covering validation, generalization, scaling, and benchmarking.",
        "Innovative use of modality-agnostic objectives and cross-modal self-supervision.",
        "Leverages existing techniques (masked prediction, contrastive loss, adapters) in a novel combination."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Feasibility of achieving true modality-agnostic learning with a single architecture is uncertain.",
        "Lacks detailed discussion of technical hurdles (e.g., tokenization disparities, modality-specific biases).",
        "Validation plan could better emphasize failure modes and boundary conditions.",
        "High computational costs and scalability challenges are not thoroughly addressed."

    "Limitations": [
        "Potential difficulty in achieving true modality-agnostic learning due to inherent differences between modalities.",
