    "Summary": "The proposal aims to unify transfer learning, meta-learning, and lifelong learning into a single framework to create more adaptive AI systems. It proposes a hierarchical memory-augmented architecture with detailed experiments to validate the approach.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Well-articulated problem statement highlighting gaps in current AI systems.",
        "Ambitious attempt to integrate three distinct learning paradigms.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan with clear benchmarks and ablation studies.",
        "Novel combination of existing techniques with potential for high impact."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks discussion of potential technical challenges, such as computational overhead.",
        "Integration of TL, ML, and LL is non-trivial, with insufficient addressing of conflicting objectives.",
        "Scalability to real-world non-stationary data is ambitious but lacks concrete plans for extreme domain shifts."

    "Questions": [
        "How will the system handle extreme domain shifts or data scarcity in real-world scenarios?",
        "What are the computational overheads of combining TL, ML, and LL, and how will they be mitigated?",
        "How will conflicting objectives (e.g., plasticity vs. stability) be balanced in practice?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "Potential high computational costs due to integration of multiple learning paradigms.",
        "Risk of suboptimal performance due to conflicting objectives between TL, ML, and LL.",
        "Scalability to real-world data streams is uncertain without more concrete plans."
