    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a theoretical framework for adaptive learning dynamics in non-convex optimization, aiming to overcome limitations of gradient descent and its variants. It combines geometry-aware dynamics, stability analysis, and adaptive meta-optimization, with a comprehensive experiment plan covering synthetic benchmarks, neural network training, theoretical validation, meta-optimizer evaluation, and real-world scaling.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement.",
        "Ambitious and original hypothesis proposing a meta-dynamic framework.",
        "Detailed and comprehensive proposed method with three distinct components.",
        "Strong scientific rigor with plans for ablation studies and theoretical validation.",
