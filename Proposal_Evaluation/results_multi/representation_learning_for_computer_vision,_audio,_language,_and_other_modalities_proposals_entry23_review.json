    "Summary": "Proposes a unified multimodal learning framework combining contrastive and generative objectives for vision, audio, and language. Features modality-agnostic encoder, hybrid training, and dynamic fusion, with experiments spanning validation, generation, transfer, scalability, and deployment.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement identifying gaps in current multimodal approaches.",
        "Novel hybrid contrastive-generative framework hypothesis.",
        "Comprehensive experimental validation plan.",
        "Integration of cutting-edge techniques (transformers, diffusion models)."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Unclear computational feasibility for high-dimensional data and real-time use.",
        "Lacks detailed risk analysis for technical challenges.",
        "Limited discussion of ablation studies and failure modes.",
        "Potential high resource requirements not addressed."
