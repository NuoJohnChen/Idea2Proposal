Weaknesses: Execution credibility could be strengthened with more detailed risk mitigation strategies., Some technical challenges (e.g., scaling human-in-the-loop adversarial collection) are not deeply explored., Lacks discussion on potential computational and resource constraints., Validation plan could benefit from more explicit comparison to existing benchmarks., Potential biases introduced by human annotators are not fully addressed.
