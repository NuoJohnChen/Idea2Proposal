    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a unified representation learning framework across vision, audio, and language modalities using a hierarchical latent space with shared and modality-specific components. The method includes core latent space construction, modality-specific adapters, and cross-modal consistency regularization. The experiment plan covers validation of the core latent space, single-modality performance, cross-modal generalization, scalability, and real-world deployment.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Highly original and ambitious hypothesis with potential for significant impact.",
        "Clear and well-motivated problem statement addressing a critical research gap.",
        "Comprehensive and rigorous experiment plan with multiple validation dimensions.",
        "Thoughtful integration of recent advances in contrastive learning and adapters."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Technical risks around modality collapse and joint training stability need more discussion.",
        "Scalability analysis could be more detailed regarding computational requirements.",
        "Real-world deployment claims may be overly optimistic without more concrete benchmarks."
