    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a unified representation learning framework that bridges vision, audio, and language by leveraging common geometric and topological structures. It introduces a modality-agnostic encoder with dynamic kernel selection, cross-modal equivariance, and meta-learning for modality adaptation. The experiment plan includes validation on synthetic tasks, cross-modal transfer benchmarks, scaling to high-dimensional data, and comparisons with state-of-the-art baselines.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Ambitious and theoretically grounded hypothesis leveraging geometric deep learning and meta-learning.",
