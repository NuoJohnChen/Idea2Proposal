    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a scalable infrastructure for distributed deep learning by optimizing communication and computation across heterogeneous hardware. It identifies inefficiencies in current frameworks and proposes an adaptive infrastructure with dynamic communication strategies, hardware-aware scheduling, and real-time profiling. The experimental plan includes benchmarking communication strategies, evaluating hardware-aware scheduling, profiling real-world workloads, validating adaptive optimization, and conducting end-to-end scalability tests.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement.",
