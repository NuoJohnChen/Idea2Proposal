    "Summary": "The proposal seeks to develop a unified theoretical framework for understanding generalization in deep learning by integrating optimization dynamics, architectural biases, and data structure. It proposes a task-dependent complexity measure and outlines a detailed experimental plan to validate this measure across synthetic and real-world datasets.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement.",
        "Ambitious hypothesis that integrates multiple factors affecting generalization.",
        "Comprehensive and logically structured experimental plan.",
        "Strong grounding in existing literature and prior work."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks a truly novel paradigm; builds heavily on existing work.",
        "Limited discussion of potential pitfalls or alternative hypotheses.",
        "Feasibility concerns due to the ambitious scope.",
        "Experimental plan could benefit from more specific metrics and baselines."

    "Questions": [
        "How will the proposed complexity measure be mathematically defined?",
        "What specific metrics will be used to evaluate the success of the complexity measure in predicting generalization?",
        "How will the proposed framework handle cases where optimization dynamics and architecture-induced biases conflict?",
        "What are the potential challenges in deriving architecture-dependent bounds for Transformers, and how will they be addressed?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "Potential difficulty in unifying diverse aspects into a single framework.",
        "Risk of oversimplifying the interplay between optimization dynamics, architecture, and data structure.",
        "Challenges in scaling the theory to very large models like LLMs.",
        "The experimental plan may require significant computational resources."
