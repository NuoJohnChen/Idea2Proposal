    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a hierarchical latent dynamics model with uncertainty-aware learning for robust autonomous navigation and planning. It integrates hierarchical world models, Bayesian neural networks, and meta-learning to address limitations in current modular and end-to-end approaches. The experiment plan includes synthetic benchmarks, real-world trials, and ablation studies.",
