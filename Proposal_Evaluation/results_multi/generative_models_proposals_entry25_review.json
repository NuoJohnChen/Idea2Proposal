    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a novel framework for generative models that leverages dynamic latent manifolds to improve controllability and interpretability. It combines stochastic differential equations, geometric regularization, and contrastive learning to achieve disentangled and controllable generation. The method is validated through synthetic and real-world datasets, with a focus on disentanglement, edit precision, and generalization.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement.",
        "Ambitious and theoretically grounded hypothesis.",
        "Detailed and innovative proposed method leveraging advanced techniques.",
