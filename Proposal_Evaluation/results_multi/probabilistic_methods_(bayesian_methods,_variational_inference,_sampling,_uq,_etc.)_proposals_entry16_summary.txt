Weaknesses: Lacks detailed technical specifics on how the hybrid approach will be implemented, particularly regarding computational efficiency., Limited discussion on computational resources and scalability constraints, especially for diffusion-based flows., Insufficient emphasis on potential failure modes and alternative approaches if the proposed method underperforms., Experiment plan could benefit from more detail on baseline comparisons and potential pitfalls.
