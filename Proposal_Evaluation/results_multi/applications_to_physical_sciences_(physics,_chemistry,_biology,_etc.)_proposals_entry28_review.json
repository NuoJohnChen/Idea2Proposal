    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop neural operator learning techniques for accelerated simulation of multiscale physical systems, addressing computational limitations of traditional methods. It proposes a hybrid architecture combining Fourier Neural Operators with wavelet-based multiresolution analysis, physics-constrained training, and adaptive sampling for rare events. The experiment plan includes benchmarking on canonical PDEs, multiscale materials modeling, coupled physics systems, scalability analysis, and experimental validation.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement.",
        "Ambitious hypothesis extending neural operators to handle sharp gradients and coupled physics.",
        "Innovative method combining hierarchical architectures, physics-constrained training, and adaptive sampling.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan covering diverse applications and validation strategies."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Limited discussion on the computational trade-offs between wavelet-based multiresolution and FNO efficiency.",
        "Unclear how adaptive sampling will balance exploration (rare events) vs. exploitation (model refinement) without excessive overhead.",
        "No explicit fallback strategy if physics-constrained training fails to converge."

    "Questions": [
        "How will the hybrid architecture handle conflicting frequency resolutions (e.g., wavelets vs. Fourier modes) in multiscale systems?",
        "What safeguards ensure adaptive sampling does not disproportionately focus on outliers at the expense of global accuracy?",
        "How will the model degrade gracefully if physics constraints are only approximately known (e.g., incomplete conservation laws)?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "Potential instability in training due to competing loss terms (wavelet reconstruction, physics constraints, data fidelity).",
        "Scalability of adaptive sampling for high-dimensional parameter spaces.",
        "Validation relies on experimental data, which may introduce noise or bias."
