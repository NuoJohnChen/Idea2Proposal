Weaknesses: Lacks clarity on how joint optimization will practically overcome inherent challenges of each component., Execution plan could benefit from more specific details on baseline comparisons and potential failure modes., Credibility of execution is uncertain due to the complexity of integrating three distinct methods., Scientific rigor could be improved with more detailed ablation studies and failure mode analysis.
