Weaknesses: Scalability concerns: The proposal does not detail how the architecture will handle the computational overhead of mixed-modal training or the memory footprint of shared weights across modalities., Feasibility of cross-modal distillation: The proposal lacks concrete examples or preliminary results showing how distillation will work in practice, especially for domains with scarce paired data., Experiment plan lacks granularity: Key steps like pseudo-pair mining and cross-modal distillation are described at a high level without methodological specifics., Limited discussion of failure modes: The proposal does not address potential pitfalls in aligning fundamentally different modality-specific features or the robustness of pseudo-pair mining.
