Overall Quality: 7
Argumentative Cohesion: 7
Intellectual Depth: 8
Execution Credibility: 6
Scientific Rigor: 7
Decision: Accept
Weaknesses: Lacks detailed discussion on potential technical challenges, such as convergence of joint optimization., Overly optimistic in execution feasibility without addressing trade-offs between sparsity and kernel approximation accuracy., Experimental plan could benefit from more rigorous validation like cross-domain generalization tests.
