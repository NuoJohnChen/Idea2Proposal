    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a framework for interpreting and disentangling learned features in deep neural networks (DNNs) by combining sparse concept bottlenecks, geometry-aware disentanglement, and cross-modal validation. The goal is to achieve interpretability through sparsity, alignment, and stability in neuron activations, validated via human evaluation and downstream tasks.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement.",
        "Innovative hybrid approach combining sparse concept bottlenecks and geometry-aware disentanglement.",
        "Detailed and comprehensive experiment plan, including benchmarking, training, analysis, and validation.",
        "Strong grounding in prior work, with references to relevant studies and datasets."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Feasibility concerns with L0 regularization and Riemannian metric analysis, which could be computationally intensive.",
        "Human evaluation component (50 participants) may lack statistical robustness.",
        "Lack of discussion on potential biases in concept definitions (e.g., Broden dataset) and their impact on interpretability.",
        "Limited risk assessment and mitigation strategies for potential technical challenges."
