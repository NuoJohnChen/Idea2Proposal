    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a hierarchical state space model (HSSM) framework for efficient long-horizon planning in robotics and autonomy. It combines HSSMs with learned latent dynamics, uncertainty-aware planning, and hardware-aware optimization. The experiment plan includes synthetic benchmarks, real-world transfer, and computational efficiency benchmarks.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement.",
        "Strong motivation and hypothesis with potential for significant impact.",
        "Detailed proposed method combining multiple advanced techniques.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan covering synthetic and real-world scenarios."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lack of detailed discussion on dynamic adjustment of hierarchical abstraction.",
        "Feasibility concerns regarding the integration of Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) into HSSMs.",
        "Real-world transfer experiments are ambitious but lack discussion of practical challenges.",
        "Baseline comparisons could be more exhaustive, including traditional methods like POMDP solvers."
