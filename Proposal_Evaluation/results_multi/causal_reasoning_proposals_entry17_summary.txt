Weaknesses: Scalability of differentiable causal discovery to high-dimensional data (e.g., 10,000 nodes) is unproven and may require impractical computational resources., Limited discussion on how counterfactual data augmentation will be validated for correctness, especially in real-world applications., No concrete plan for handling cases where the causal structure is partially unknown or misspecified.
