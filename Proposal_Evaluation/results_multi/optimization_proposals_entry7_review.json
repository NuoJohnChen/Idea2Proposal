    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a hybrid optimizer that dynamically switches between zeroth-order and first-order methods based on gradient reliability for high-dimensional non-convex problems. It includes gradient reliability estimation, adaptive update rules, and scaling techniques, with a detailed experiment plan covering synthetic and real-world tasks.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement highlighting limitations of existing methods.",
        "Innovative hypothesis on dynamic gradient reliability assessment.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan with synthetic benchmarks, real-world tasks, and ablation studies.",
        "Proposal of scaling techniques for high-dimensional problems."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Feasibility of the gradient confidence metric is not rigorously justified.",
        "Computational overhead of the hybrid approach is not thoroughly discussed.",
        "Lack of detailed theoretical analysis on the gradient confidence metric and surrogate model scalability.",
        "Potential risks in integrating disparate optimization paradigms are not fully addressed."
