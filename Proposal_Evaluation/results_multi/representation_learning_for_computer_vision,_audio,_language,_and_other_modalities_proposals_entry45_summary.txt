Weaknesses: Lack of clear differentiation from existing unified multimodal frameworks like Perceiver IO or Unified-IO., Feasibility concerns regarding the modality-agnostic design, scalability, and computational burden., Limited discussion on potential failure modes or alternative approaches if the unified framework underperforms., Validation plan may not fully address the core challenge of maintaining performance across diverse modalities without modality-specific adaptations.
