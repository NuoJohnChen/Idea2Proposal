Weaknesses: Limited discussion on scalability to very large models like GPT-3 or Vision Transformers., Potential computational challenges, especially with Riemannian metric optimization, are not fully addressed., Subjectivity in human evaluations (AMT) could be a limitation but is not discussed in depth., Generalizability across different DNN architectures and tasks could be more thoroughly explored.
