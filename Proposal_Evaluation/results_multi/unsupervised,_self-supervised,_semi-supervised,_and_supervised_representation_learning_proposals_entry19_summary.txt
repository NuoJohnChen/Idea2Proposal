Overall Quality: 7
Argumentative Cohesion: 8
Intellectual Depth: 8
Execution Credibility: 6
Scientific Rigor: 7
Decision: Accept
Weaknesses: Lacks critical technical specifics (e.g., implementation of 'confidence gate' mechanism, optimization of dynamic weighting)., Experiment plan could benefit from more rigorous validation strategies (e.g., stress-testing on imbalanced datasets or adversarial scenarios)., Proposed method is detailed but lacks depth in addressing potential technical challenges.
