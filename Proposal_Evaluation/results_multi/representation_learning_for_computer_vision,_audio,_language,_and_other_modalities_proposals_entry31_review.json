    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a unified multimodal representation learning framework bridging vision, audio, and language through hierarchical contrastive alignment, dynamic modality routing, and self-supervised pretraining. It addresses current limitations of siloed approaches with a shared compositional latent space.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement with strong motivation",
        "Innovative approach combining hierarchical alignment and dynamic routing",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan with validation steps",
        "High potential impact in multimodal learning"
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Unclear computational feasibility/scalability",
        "Insufficient risk analysis for dynamic routing",
        "Minimal discussion of dataset biases/ethical aspects"
    ],
