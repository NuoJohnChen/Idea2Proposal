    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a hierarchical state space model (SSM) for efficient long-horizon planning in robotics, aiming to address computational inefficiency and scalability issues in existing methods like MCTS, MPC, and Transformer-based planners. The approach combines hierarchical decomposition, dynamic state selection, and model-free fine-tuning to improve planning efficiency and performance.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement identifying gaps in current methods.",
        "Compelling hypothesis linking hierarchical SSMs to improved planning efficiency.",
        "Detailed and structured proposed method with three distinct components.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan covering synthetic tasks, real-world deployment, generalization, and computational efficiency."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Novelty of the approach is unclear; hierarchical decomposition and dynamic state selection are not new concepts.",
        "Execution plan is somewhat optimistic, particularly regarding real-world deployment and generalization.",
        "Lacks emphasis on failure modes and edge cases in experimental validation."

    "Questions": [
        "How does the proposed hierarchical SSM differ from existing hierarchical planning methods?",
        "What are the specific challenges in real-world deployment, and how will they be addressed?",
        "How will the model handle extreme edge cases or highly stochastic environments?",
        "How will the dynamic state selection mechanism handle noisy or incomplete perceptual inputs?",
        "What are the fallback strategies if the hierarchical decomposition fails to generate coherent subgoals?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "Potential over-reliance on synthetic tasks for initial validation.",
        "Generalization to unseen environments may be limited by the quality of perceptual features.",
        "Computational efficiency claims need empirical validation on diverse hardware.",
        "Potential instability in RL-based fine-tuning.",
        "Scalability of dynamic state selection in high-dimensional state spaces."
