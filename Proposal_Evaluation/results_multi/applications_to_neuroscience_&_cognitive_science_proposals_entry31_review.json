    "Summary": "The proposal aims to integrate biologically inspired dynamic gating mechanisms into computational models of attention, combining hierarchical predictive coding, reinforcement-driven gating, and spiking neural networks. It includes a comprehensive experiment plan for validation, benchmarking, and clinical relevance testing.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement.",
        "Ambitious and intellectually deep hypothesis.",
