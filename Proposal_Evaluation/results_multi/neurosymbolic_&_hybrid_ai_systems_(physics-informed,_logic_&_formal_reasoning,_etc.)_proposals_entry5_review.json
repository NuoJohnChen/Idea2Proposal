    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a hybrid neurosymbolic AI system integrating physics-informed learning with formal reasoning, addressing the trade-off between scalability and interpretability in current AI systems. It proposes a unified architecture with neural encoders, differentiable symbolic reasoners, and physics-informed loss functions, along with a gating mechanism for dynamic weighting. The experiment plan includes synthetic benchmarking, scientific computing tasks, and language integration.",
