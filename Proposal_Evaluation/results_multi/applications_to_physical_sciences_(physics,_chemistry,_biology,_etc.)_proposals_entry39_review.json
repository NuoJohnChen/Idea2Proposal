    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a hybrid neural operator architecture combining Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) and graph neural networks (GNNs) to accelerate multiscale physical simulations. It targets applications in fluid dynamics, molecular dynamics, materials science, and quantum chemistry, with a focus on learning operator mappings for efficient inference across diverse scenarios. The method includes physics-constrained training and efficient inference via domain decomposition.",
