    "Summary": "The proposal aims to bridge the gap between correlation and causation in neural networks by integrating causal structure learning directly into neural architectures. It proposes a hybrid framework combining differentiable causal discovery, intervention-aware latent spaces, and causal attention mechanisms. The experimental plan includes synthetic data validation, benchmarking on causal inference tasks, real-world applications, ablation studies, and generalization tests under distribution shifts.",
