    "Summary": "The proposal aims to improve sample efficiency and exploration in reinforcement learning by integrating uncertainty-aware planning into latent world models. It builds on existing MBRL methods like Dreamer and proposes a hybrid approach combining probabilistic latent dynamics models with optimistic planning. The experimental plan includes validation, benchmarking, ablation studies, and real-world deployment.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-motivated problem statement.",
        "Novel integration of latent world models and uncertainty-aware planning.",
        "Comprehensive experimental plan with validation, benchmarking, and ablation studies.",
        "Strong grounding in recent literature (e.g., Dreamer, PETS).",
        "Ambitious real-world deployment goal."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks detailed discussion on computational overhead of MCTS in high-dimensional spaces.",
        "Scalability of the hybrid approach is not thoroughly addressed.",
        "Risk mitigation strategies for potential failures in uncertainty estimation are missing.",
        "Experimental plan could benefit from more diverse baselines (e.g., curiosity-driven methods)."
