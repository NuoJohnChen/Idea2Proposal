Overall Quality: 6
Argumentative Cohesion: 7
Intellectual Depth: 7
Execution Credibility: 5
Scientific Rigor: 6
Decision: Reject
Weaknesses: Lacks depth in justifying the connection between non-stationarity detection and specific reset mechanisms., Feasibility of integrating change-point detection into optimization loops is questionable., Overly optimistic about computational overhead and scalability., Experimental plan lacks detail on fair baseline implementation and ablation studies.
