    "Summary": "The proposal introduces Adaptive Prior RL (APRL), a framework to improve sample efficiency in reinforcement learning by dynamically weighting model-based priors, integrating hierarchical priors, and using uncertainty-driven exploration. The method aims to outperform existing model-free and model-based RL techniques, particularly in sparse-reward and long-horizon tasks.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-motivated problem statement highlighting the limitations of current RL methods.",
        "Innovative hypothesis proposing adaptive model trust, hierarchical priors, and directed exploration.",
        "Detailed proposed method building on established techniques like probabilistic ensemble dynamics models and physics-informed RL.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan covering toy tasks, robotics benchmarks, long-horizon tasks, and scalability tests."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks explicit discussion of potential technical challenges, such as computational overhead of the meta-learner.",
        "Integration of hierarchical priors could be more detailed, especially regarding how different levels of abstraction will be combined.",
        "Ablation studies are mentioned but lack granularity in how component contributions will be isolated and analyzed."

        "Can you provide more details on how the attention mechanisms will selectively combine hierarchical priors?",
        "What are the specific metrics for evaluating the robustness of APRL to model error in the toy tasks?"

    "Limitations": [
        "Potential computational overhead from the meta-learner and ensemble dynamics models.",
        "Integration of hierarchical priors may introduce complexity and require careful tuning.",
        "Generalization to unseen environments may be limited by the quality of the learned dynamics models."
