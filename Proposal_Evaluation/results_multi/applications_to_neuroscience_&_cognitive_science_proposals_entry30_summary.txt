Weaknesses: Lack of specificity in technical implementation details (e.g., gating mechanism in spiking neurons)., Uncertain feasibility of integrating diverse mechanisms into a unified framework., Experimental plan could benefit from more concrete details on baseline comparisons and potential pitfalls., Potential challenges in aligning model with neural data (e.g., EEG/MEG).
