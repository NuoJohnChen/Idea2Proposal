    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a hybrid neurosymbolic system that integrates neural networks with symbolic reasoning for robust, interpretable AI. It addresses limitations in current hybrid approaches by proposing a unified architecture with differentiable symbolic layers and physics-informed loss functions. The method builds on prior work like Neural Logic Machines and Physics-Informed Neural Networks, extending them to handle continuous domains and large-scale symbolic rule sets. The experiment plan includes validation on synthetic tasks, physics domains, and real-world benchmarks.",
