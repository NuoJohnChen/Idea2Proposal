Weaknesses: Lacks detailed technical specifics on dynamic gradient fusion and latent space alignment., Feasibility of scaling to large datasets (e.g., JFT-300M) is unclear without computational resource details., Limited discussion on potential technical challenges and risk mitigation strategies., Task-agnostic evaluation protocol is described but lacks depth in metric definitions.
