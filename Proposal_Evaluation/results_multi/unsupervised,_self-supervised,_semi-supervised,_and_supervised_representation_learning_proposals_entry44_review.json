    "Summary": "The proposal introduces Adaptive Representation Fusion (ARF), a framework to unify unsupervised, self-supervised, semi-supervised, and supervised representation learning paradigms. It aims to dynamically combine these paradigms based on data availability and task requirements, addressing inefficiencies in isolated approaches. The method includes unified objective design, dynamic paradigm selection, and gradient harmonization. The experiment plan covers benchmark comparisons, dynamic selection evaluation, cross-modal transfer, scalability analysis, and real-world deployment.",
