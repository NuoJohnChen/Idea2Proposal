Weaknesses: Feasibility of integrating SNNs with large-scale convolutional backbones is not thoroughly discussed., Potential technical challenges in real-time adaptation and scalability are understated., Limited discussion on interpretability challenges when correlating model outputs with fMRI/EEG data., Ablation studies, while planned, lack detail on how they will isolate specific mechanisms.
