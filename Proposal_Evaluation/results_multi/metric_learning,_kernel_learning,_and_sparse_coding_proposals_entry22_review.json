    "Summary": "The proposal aims to unify metric learning, kernel learning, and sparse coding into a single framework for robust representation learning. It addresses limitations of current hybrid approaches and proposes a joint optimization problem with a shared latent space. The method includes a unified objective function, efficient optimization strategies, and a hybrid neural network architecture. The experiment plan covers synthetic data validation, benchmarking, ablation studies, scalability testing, and downstream task evaluation.",
