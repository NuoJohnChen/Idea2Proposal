    "Summary": "The proposal aims to accelerate the discovery of high-temperature superconductors (HTS) using a hybrid ML approach combining graph neural networks (GNNs) with physical constraints. The method involves data curation, model development, and active learning for experimental validation, with a detailed step-by-step experiment plan.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement.",
        "Strong motivation and hypothesis linking ML to superconductivity research.",
        "Detailed proposed method and experiment plan.",
        "Comprehensive dataset construction and benchmarking approach."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Dataset quality concerns (e.g., missing Tc values, inconsistent structural descriptors).",
        "Limited discussion on model interpretability for domain scientists.",
        "Scalability of GNNs to screen ~100,000 hypothetical compounds is unproven.",
        "Experimental validation relies heavily on external collaboration, introducing delays."

        "What is the plan if active learning prioritizes unstable or unsynthesizable candidates?"

    "Limitations": [
        "Potential bias in existing superconductivity data (e.g., overrepresentation of cuprates).",
        "Computational cost of DFT validation for top candidates.",
        "Generalizability to entirely new material classes."
