Weaknesses: Lacks detailed technical specifics in the proposed method (e.g., adversarial module integration, dynamic DRO implementation)., Scalability and computational costs are not thoroughly addressed, especially for high-dimensional data., Over-reliance on the assumption that causal features can be reliably identified and separated., Theoretical analysis is mentioned but not detailed, leaving gaps in understanding generalization guarantees.
