    "Summary": "The proposal focuses on optimizing distributed training infrastructure for large-scale AI models through a hardware-software co-design approach. It identifies key bottlenecks in communication overhead, memory constraints, and hardware utilization, and proposes a three-part solution involving topology-aware communication primitives, memory-efficient distributed execution, and hardware-aware compiler extensions. The experimental plan includes benchmarking, evaluation, validation, and ablation studies.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement.",
        "Strong motivation and hypothesis aligned with the identified problems.",
