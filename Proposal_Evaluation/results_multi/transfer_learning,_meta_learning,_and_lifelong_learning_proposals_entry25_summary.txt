Execution Credibility: 6
Scientific Rigor: 8
Decision: Accept
Weaknesses: Lacks depth in discussing potential technical challenges and risks, particularly computational overhead., Execution credibility could be improved with more detailed risk mitigation strategies, especially for gradient alignment., Scalability to very long task sequences (100+ tasks) is not fully demonstrated, and the computational cost of combining these methods is not thoroughly addressed.
