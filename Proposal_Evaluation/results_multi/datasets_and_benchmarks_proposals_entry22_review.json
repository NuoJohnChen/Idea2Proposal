    "Summary": "The proposal aims to advance dataset and benchmark design for robust machine learning evaluation by addressing limitations in current benchmarks, such as dataset bias, benchmark saturation, and insufficient stress-testing. It proposes a three-pronged approach involving controlled distribution shifts, diagnostic challenge sets, and dynamic evaluation protocols, with a detailed experiment plan to validate the methods.",
