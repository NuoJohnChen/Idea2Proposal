    "Summary": "The proposal aims to improve reinforcement learning (RL) efficiency by dynamically integrating learned models with structured priors. It addresses the sample inefficiency problem in RL through a three-part approach: uncertainty-aware model integration, meta-learning for prior adaptation, and efficient exploration with priors. The experiment plan includes validation, benchmarking, testing, scaling, and ablation studies.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-motivated problem statement.",
        "Compelling hypothesis with potential for significant impact.",
        "Detailed and well-structured proposed method.",
        "Thorough experiment plan covering multiple aspects of validation."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks detailed discussion on computational resources and scalability, especially in high-dimensional spaces.",
        "Potential challenges in meta-learning for prior adaptation are not fully addressed, including convergence and stability issues.",
        "Limited discussion on risk assessment and mitigation strategies for cases where priors are highly misaligned.",
        "Robustness of uncertainty estimation in high-dimensional spaces is not critically analyzed, which could limit practical applicability."

    "Questions": [
        "What computational resources will be required for scaling to complex domains like NVIDIA Isaac Gym, and how will the method handle the associated computational overhead?",
        "How will the meta-learning component ensure stable adaptation when the prior is significantly misaligned with the task, and what are the failure modes?",
        "Can the uncertainty-aware model integration maintain robustness in high-dimensional spaces with noisy or sparse data?",
        "How will the method ensure exploration efficiency in scenarios where priors are less informative or even misleading?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "Integration of diverse priors may introduce complexity and instability, particularly in high-dimensional settings.",
        "Meta-learning for prior adaptation may require extensive tuning and computational resources, potentially limiting scalability.",
        "Scalability to high-dimensional spaces with non-rigid dynamics is non-trivial and may require additional approximations.",
        "Reliance on prior informativeness may limit applicability in scenarios where priors are sparse or unreliable."
