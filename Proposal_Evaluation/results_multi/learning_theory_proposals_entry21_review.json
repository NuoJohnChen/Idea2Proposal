    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a theoretical framework for adaptive learning dynamics in non-convex optimization using SDE-based modeling and Lyapunov analysis. It hypothesizes that adaptive methods' success is due to their implicit bias toward flatter minima, formalized via SDEs with state-dependent noise, and proposes a new optimizer (CASD) that dynamically adjusts noise structure based on local curvature. The experimental plan includes validation of SDE approximations, convergence analysis, generalization evaluation, and computational benchmarking.",
