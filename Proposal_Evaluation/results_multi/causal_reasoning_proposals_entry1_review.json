    "Summary": "The proposal aims to bridge the gap between correlation and causation in neural networks by developing a hybrid architecture that combines neural networks with causal reasoning primitives. It proposes a three-part framework involving causal latent representation, intervention-aware training, and scalable causal discovery. The experiment plan includes validation on synthetic and real-world datasets, scalability analysis, and ablation studies.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Addresses a significant and timely problem in AI.",
        "Well-articulated motivation and hypothesis grounded in prior work.",
        "Ambitious and innovative proposed method.",
        "Detailed experiment plan with synthetic and real-world datasets."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Feasibility concerns regarding technical challenges like differentiable do-calculus operators and dynamic masking mechanisms.",
        "Lacks discussion on potential failure modes and risk mitigation strategies.",
        "Execution details are somewhat vague, particularly for the intervention-aware training component."
