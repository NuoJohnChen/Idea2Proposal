    "Summary": "The proposal aims to bridge the gap between correlation and causation in neural networks by developing a framework that integrates causal graph learning, intervention-aware training, and counterfactual prediction. The goal is to create models that can infer causal dependencies, generalize under distribution shifts, and answer counterfactual queries.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement.",
        "Strong motivation grounded in recent literature.",
        "Ambitious and original hypothesis focusing on disentangling causal mechanisms.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan covering synthetic and real-world datasets.",
        "Includes ablation studies to isolate component contributions."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks detailed discussion on potential technical challenges (e.g., scalability of differentiable attention mechanism).",
        "No explicit mention of computational overhead for the counterfactual module.",
        "Risk mitigation strategies are not thoroughly addressed.",
        "Feasibility of integrating Pearl\u2019s SCMs into neural networks is not thoroughly addressed."

        "How will the proposed method handle cases where ground-truth causal graphs are not available?",
        "What computational resources will be required for the experiments?"

    "Limitations": [
        "Potential scalability issues with the proposed causal graph learning mechanism.",
        "Computational overhead of the counterfactual module may limit practical applicability.",
        "Generalization to real-world datasets may be challenging due to unobserved confounders.",
