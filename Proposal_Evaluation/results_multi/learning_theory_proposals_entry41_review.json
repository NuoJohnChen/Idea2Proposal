    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a theoretical framework for adaptive learning dynamics in non-convex optimization, focusing on methods like Adam and AdaGrad. It hypothesizes that these methods implicitly recondition the loss landscape via stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and plans to validate this through synthetic and real-world experiments, including scaling to large language models (LLMs).",
    "Strengths": [
        "Ambitious and original hypothesis linking adaptive methods to local geometry exploitation via SDEs.",
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement highlighting a significant gap in theoretical understanding.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan covering validation, benchmarking, generalization, and scaling.",
        "Strong theoretical grounding with tools like stochastic approximation theory and matrix concentration inequalities."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "High-risk theoretical derivations with uncertain feasibility for complex adaptive dynamics.",
        "Inadequate discussion of computational bottlenecks, especially for LLM experiments.",
        "Lacks concrete fallback plans if the SDE framework proves intractable or fails to generalize.",
        "Minimal risk mitigation strategies for theoretical or experimental failures."

    "Limitations": [
        "Theoretical derivations may require simplifying assumptions that limit practical applicability.",
        "Experimental validation on LLMs may be computationally prohibitive or inconclusive.",
