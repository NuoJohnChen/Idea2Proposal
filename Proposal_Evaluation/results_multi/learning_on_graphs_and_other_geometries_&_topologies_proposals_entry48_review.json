    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a unified geometric deep learning framework for non-Euclidean data (graphs, manifolds) by combining symmetry-aware architectures, geometric priors, and cross-domain transfer learning. It addresses limitations in current GNNs regarding expressivity, OOD generalization, and domain fragmentation.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-motivated problem statement with well-identified gaps in current methods",
        "Ambitious but theoretically grounded hypothesis leveraging equivariance and geometric priors",
        "Technically sophisticated proposed method combining multiple advanced techniques (dynamic curvature, Hodge Laplacians, meta-learning)",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan covering synthetic benchmarks, OOD tests, and real-world applications",
        "Potential for broad impact in molecular design, social networks, and 3D vision"
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Unification claim may be overstated given technical challenges of combining diverse geometries",
        "Computational feasibility of integrated framework not fully addressed",
        "Lacks detailed discussion of potential conflicts between geometric priors during transfer",
        "Risk of overpromising given scope (graphs + manifolds + discrete geometries + transfer)",
        "Execution plan could be more concrete in addressing technical challenges"

    "Questions": [
        "How will you resolve potential conflicts between geometric priors (e.g., hyperbolic vs spherical) during cross-domain transfer?",
        "What are the computational complexity bounds for the full integrated framework?",
        "Have you identified any fundamental limitations where unification across all proposed geometries might be impossible?",
        "How will dynamic curvature adaptation scale to very large graphs?",
        "Can you provide more details on the ablation studies to isolate the contributions of each component?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "Integration overhead may outweigh benefits for specific domains",
        "Meta-learning geometric priors may require prohibitive amounts of diverse training data",
        "Dynamic curvature adaptation could introduce instability in optimization",
        "Generalization to extremely diverse geometric domains may be difficult",
        "Computational overhead of equivariant architectures on large-scale real-world datasets"
