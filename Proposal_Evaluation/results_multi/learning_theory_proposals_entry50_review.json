    "Summary": "The proposal seeks to develop a theoretical framework for adaptive learning dynamics in non-convex optimization, linking optimization dynamics, architecture, and generalization. It combines dynamical systems reformulation, adaptive gradient analysis, and generalization bounds, with a detailed experiment plan involving synthetic and real-world validation.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Compelling problem statement and motivation.",
        "Ambitious and original hypothesis linking optimization dynamics, architecture, and generalization.",
        "Detailed and well-structured experiment plan.",
        "Strong potential impact on understanding optimization in deep learning."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Overly ambitious theoretical derivations without clear fallback plans.",
        "Lacks detailed discussion of potential technical challenges and risks.",
        "Experimental plan could better align with theoretical validation."
