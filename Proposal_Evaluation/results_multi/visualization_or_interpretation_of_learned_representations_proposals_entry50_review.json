    "Summary": "The proposal aims to improve the interpretability of deep neural networks by developing metrics for interpretability, hierarchical feature visualization, and disentanglement via geometric regularization. It plans to benchmark existing methods, validate hierarchical visualization, test disentanglement efficacy, scale to real-world data, and conduct ablation studies.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement and motivation.",
        "Detailed experimental plan with multiple steps.",
        "Addresses a timely and important problem in deep learning.",
        "Compelling hypothesis about the compositional nature of learned features.",
        "Rigorous validation plan including ablation studies and real-world application."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Limited novelty in the proposed methods compared to existing work.",
        "Lacks depth in addressing potential technical challenges.",
        "Validation plan could be more rigorous, especially in differentiating from existing baselines.",
        "Feasibility of geometric regularization approach is not fully justified.",
        "Scalability of hierarchical visualization to larger networks is unclear."

    "Questions": [
        "How does the proposed geometric regularization differ significantly from existing disentanglement methods?",
        "What specific technical challenges do you anticipate in scaling to real-world data, and how will you address them?",
        "How will you ensure that the interpretability metrics are not biased towards certain types of features or datasets?",
        "How will the geometric regularization loss be implemented to ensure it does not degrade model performance?",
        "What are the computational costs of the dynamic activation graph, especially for deeper networks?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "Potential over-reliance on existing datasets (e.g., Broden, dSprites) which may not fully capture real-world complexity.",
        "The proposed methods may not generalize well to other types of neural architectures beyond ResNet-50 and VAEs.",
        "The interpretability metrics may be subjective and hard to quantify objectively.",
        "Potential over-reliance on human-annotated concepts, which may introduce bias.",
        "Geometric regularization may not generalize well to all types of latent spaces."
