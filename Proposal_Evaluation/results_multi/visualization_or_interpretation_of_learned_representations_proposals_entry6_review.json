    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a dynamic, disentangled visualization framework for interpreting neural representations in deep networks, combining techniques like SVCCA, CAVs, sparse autoencoders, and NMF. It aims to track feature evolution, quantify neuron-concept alignment, and disentangle polysemantic features, with a detailed experiment plan including benchmarking, downstream validation, and human interpretability studies.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Addresses a significant and timely problem in deep learning interpretability.",
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement with strong motivation.",
        "Novel combination of established techniques into a unified framework.",
        "Comprehensive and detailed experiment plan with rigorous validation steps.",
        "Strong grounding in existing literature."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks detailed discussion on scalability to larger models (e.g., GPT-3, Vision Transformers).",
        "Computational costs and potential technical challenges are not thoroughly addressed.",
        "Human interpretability scores via MTurk may introduce subjectivity.",
        "Limited critical self-assessment and risk mitigation strategies."

        "How will human interpretability scores be standardized to reduce subjectivity?",
        "What are the specific criteria for selecting human-defined concepts in CAVs?"

    "Limitations": [
        "Scalability to larger models may be limited due to computational constraints.",
        "Effectiveness of disentanglement techniques may vary across architectures and datasets.",
