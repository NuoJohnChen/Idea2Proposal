Overall Quality: 6
Argumentative Cohesion: 7
Intellectual Depth: 8
Execution Credibility: 5
Scientific Rigor: 6
Decision: Reject
Weaknesses: Lacks detailed technical solutions for critical challenges (e.g., gating network stability, computational overhead)., Experimental plan is somewhat generic and lacks depth in addressing potential failure modes., No preliminary results or evidence to support the feasibility of the proposed integration., The adaptive training protocol is described at a high level but lacks concrete implementation details.
