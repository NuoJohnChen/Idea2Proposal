    "Summary": "The proposal addresses dataset bias and evaluation gaps in machine learning benchmarks by introducing a framework emphasizing diversity, dynamic evaluation, and multi-metric trade-offs. It includes bias-aware dataset curation, dynamic evaluation protocols, and holistic metrics, with a detailed experiment plan to validate the approach.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement with relevant citations.",
        "Strong motivation and hypothesis that current benchmarks incentivize exploiting dataset artifacts.",
        "Comprehensive proposed method covering bias-aware dataset curation, dynamic evaluation, and holistic metrics.",
        "Detailed and logically structured experiment plan."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lack of specific details on implementing synthetic diversity via controlled perturbations.",
        "Feasibility of partnering with domain experts for cross-cultural data curation not thoroughly discussed.",
        "Practical challenges in implementing dynamic evaluation protocols (e.g., computational cost).",
        "Holistic metrics section could benefit from more concrete examples of composite metrics and weighting schemes."
