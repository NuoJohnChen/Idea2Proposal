    "Summary": "The proposal addresses scalability and robustness challenges in probabilistic inference by integrating deep learning with advanced Bayesian methods. It proposes a unified framework combining expressive variational families, adaptive MCMC, and hybrid inference, with a comprehensive experiment plan to validate the approach.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement.",
        "Ambitious and original hypothesis proposing a unified framework.",
        "Detailed and methodical experiment plan with ablation studies.",
        "Strong scientific rigor with planned performance metrics and comparisons."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks detailed discussion on potential technical challenges and risks.",
        "Execution plan for hybrid inference could be more grounded.",
        "Limited discussion on how dynamic strategy selection will be implemented practically."
