    "Summary": "The proposal outlines a machine learning approach to accelerate the discovery of high-temperature superconductors (HTS) using graph neural networks (GNNs) and high-throughput screening. It aims to predict critical temperatures (Tc) and identify novel HTS materials through virtual screening, DFT validation, and experimental synthesis.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement highlighting the limitations of current methods.",
        "Strong motivation with potential high impact in the field of superconductivity.",
        "Innovative use of GNNs and equivariant models for HTS discovery.",
        "Detailed step-by-step experiment plan with clear milestones."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Overly optimistic about the scalability of high-throughput screening and experimental synthesis.",
        "Lacks detailed discussion on potential technical challenges and risk mitigation strategies.",
        "Uncertainty about the accuracy of ML predictions and their validation against DFT.",
        "Limited discussion on interpretability and generalizability of the ML model."

    "Questions": [
        "How will the model handle the inherent noise and variability in experimental Tc data?",
        "What are the specific criteria for selecting the top candidates for DFT validation?",
        "How will the model's uncertainty quantification be validated experimentally?",
        "What are the backup plans if the experimental synthesis of top candidates fails?",
        "How will the interpretability of the model be ensured beyond SHAP analysis?"

    "Limitations": [
        "Reliance on existing databases may limit the diversity of materials considered.",
        "ML predictions may not generalize well to entirely new chemical spaces.",
        "DFT validation is computationally expensive and may not scale as proposed.",
        "Experimental synthesis and measurement of Tc are non-trivial and time-consuming."
