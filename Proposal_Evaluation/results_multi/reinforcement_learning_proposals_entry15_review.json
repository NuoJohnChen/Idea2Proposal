    "Summary": "The proposal aims to improve exploration in reinforcement learning by integrating latent world models with uncertainty-aware intrinsic rewards, distinguishing between epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty. The method involves training a latent world model with uncertainty quantification, designing an uncertainty-aware intrinsic reward, and combining it with a model-free RL algorithm. The experiment plan includes validation, comparison with baselines, scaling tests, real-world transfer, and ablation studies.",
