    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a dynamic, multi-dimensional benchmarking framework for AI evaluation, addressing limitations in current benchmarks such as saturation, biases, and lack of cross-modal evaluation. It includes dynamic task generation, bias-aware dataset curation, and cross-modal evaluation, with a structured experiment plan involving meta-analysis, prototype implementation, and longitudinal evaluation.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Comprehensive problem statement with clear articulation of current benchmark limitations.",
        "Strong motivation backed by recent studies and a well-defined hypothesis.",
        "Detailed proposed method with three innovative components.",
        "Structured experiment plan with quantifiable metrics and success criteria.",
        "High scientific rigor, including meta-analysis and longitudinal evaluation.",
        "Potential to significantly influence AI evaluation practices and standards."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Feasibility concerns due to the broad scope across multiple modalities and domains.",
        "Limited discussion on potential technical challenges and mitigation strategies.",
        "Lack of detailed ablation studies or failure mode analysis in the validation plan."
