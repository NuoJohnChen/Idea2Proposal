    "Summary": "The proposal aims to integrate causal reasoning into neural networks by combining gradient-based learning with symbolic causal operations. It proposes a three-part framework involving causal representation learning, neural causal discovery, and counterfactual-augmented training. The experimental plan includes validation on synthetic and real-world datasets, with a focus on scalability and robustness.",
