    "Summary": "The proposal aims to bridge the gap between correlation and causation in neural networks by developing a hybrid framework that combines neural networks with causal graphical models. The method includes causal representation learning, intervention-aware training, and a modular architecture. The experiment plan involves validation on synthetic and real-world datasets, scalability analysis, and human-in-the-loop evaluation.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement.",
        "Innovative combination of neural networks and causal graphical models.",
        "Detailed and comprehensive experiment plan.",
        "Strong grounding in recent literature."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Feasibility of intervention-aware training is not fully discussed.",
        "Scalability of the causal discovery module is a potential concern.",
        "Lacks detailed discussion on technical challenges and mitigation strategies."
