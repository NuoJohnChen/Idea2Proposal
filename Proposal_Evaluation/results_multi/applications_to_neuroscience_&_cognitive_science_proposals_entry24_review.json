    "Summary": "The proposal aims to bridge computational models and cognitive neuroscience by developing a hybrid model combining scalable attention mechanisms with biologically plausible recurrence. It addresses the gap between static models and dynamic neural processes, with validation through synthetic tasks, neural data alignment, behavioral predictions, ablation studies, and clinical generalization.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement highlighting the gap between static models and dynamic neural processes.",
        "Ambitious hypothesis proposing a novel integration of predictive coding and attention-based gating.",
        "Detailed experiment plan covering multiple validation steps.",
        "High intellectual depth with potential for significant impact in the field."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks specific details on the implementation of the hybrid model.",
        "Potential technical challenges are not thoroughly discussed.",
        "Alignment between model and neural data needs more concrete quantification methods.",
        "Execution credibility and scientific rigor could be strengthened with more detailed plans."
