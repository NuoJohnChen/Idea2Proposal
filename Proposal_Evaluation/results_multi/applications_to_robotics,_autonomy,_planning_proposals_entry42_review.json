    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a hybrid hierarchical task planning approach for robotic autonomy, combining neural representations with symbolic reasoning to bridge high-level goals and low-level execution. It aims to address the brittleness of current systems by integrating learned neural sub-policies with symbolic task graphs, enabling dynamic replanning and uncertainty-aware grounding.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement identifying a well-known gap in robotic autonomy.",
        "Plausible hypothesis building on recent neuro-symbolic methods.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan with multiple validation steps.",
        "Integration of human-in-the-loop feedback for task graph refinement.",
        "Strong intellectual depth and ambition."

    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks depth in technical implementation details, particularly for neural backtracking.",
        "Scalability claims are not sufficiently justified.",
        "Experiment metrics and baseline comparisons could be more specific.",
        "Limited discussion of potential failure modes in real-world deployment.",
