    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a unified representation learning framework across vision, audio, and language modalities, addressing the fragmentation in current modality-specific approaches. It proposes a modality-agnostic tokenizer, cross-modal contrastive learning, and dynamic attention with modality bias. The experiment plan includes validation of tokenization flexibility, cross-modal transfer benchmarks, scaling to large-scale data, efficiency analysis, and ablation studies.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement highlighting fragmentation in current approaches.",
        "Ambitious hypothesis proposing a shared latent structure across modalities.",
        "Innovative components like modality-agnostic tokenization and dynamic attention.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan covering various aspects of the proposed method."
