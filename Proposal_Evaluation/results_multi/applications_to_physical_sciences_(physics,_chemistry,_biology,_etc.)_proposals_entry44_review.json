    "Summary": "The proposal aims to accelerate the discovery of quantum materials by combining equivariant neural networks and topological data analysis. It addresses limitations of traditional methods like DFT and heuristic ML, focusing on preserving quantum-mechanical accuracy and capturing global topological invariants. The method involves developing SE(3)-equivariant GNNs, integrating topological descriptors, and using active learning for high-throughput screening.",
