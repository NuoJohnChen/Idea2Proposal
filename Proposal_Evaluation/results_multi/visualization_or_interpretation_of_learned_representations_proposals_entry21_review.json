    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a framework for visualizing and disentangling learned features in deep neural networks, combining dynamic feature graph construction, orthogonal subspace disentanglement, and quantitative interpretability metrics. It aims to address the opacity of deep learning representations by providing a unified approach that scales to modern architectures and includes real-world deployment.",
