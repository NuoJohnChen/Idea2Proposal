    "Summary": "The proposal introduces Adaptive Prior RL (APRL), a framework to improve RL sample efficiency by dynamically integrating model-based priors with model-free policy optimization based on uncertainty estimates. It includes uncertainty-aware dynamics learning, adaptive policy optimization, and meta-learning for prior transfer. The experiment plan is comprehensive, covering validation, comparison, scaling, real-world feasibility, and ablation studies.",
