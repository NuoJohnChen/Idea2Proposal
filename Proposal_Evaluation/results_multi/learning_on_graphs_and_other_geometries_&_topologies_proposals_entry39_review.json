    "Summary": "The proposal aims to unify geometric deep learning across Euclidean and non-Euclidean domains by addressing scalability, generalization, and geometric diversity. It proposes geometry-aware architectures, scalable graph learning, and cross-geometry transfer, with a detailed experiment plan.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Well-structured problem statement with clear motivation.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan covering multiple evaluation dimensions.",
        "Ambitious scope targeting both theoretical and practical challenges."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Limited novelty in proposed methods; heavily builds on existing techniques (e.g., hyperbolic convolutions, meta-learning).",
        "Vague technical details on integrating diverse geometries (e.g., hyperbolic + spherical).",
        "Scalability claims lack concrete implementation strategies for extreme-scale graphs.",
        "Minimal discussion of failure modes or risks in cross-geometry transfer."

    "Questions": [
        "What specific algorithmic innovations differentiate this work from prior geometric deep learning methods?",
        "How will the framework handle conflicting geometric priors (e.g., hyperbolic vs. spherical) in hybrid data?",
        "What are the computational limits of the proposed hierarchical message-passing scheme?",
        "How will out-of-distribution generalization be quantified beyond standard benchmarks?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "High risk of incremental contribution due to reliance on established techniques.",
        "Integration of heterogeneous geometries may introduce untested computational bottlenecks.",
        "Real-world applicability is unclear without validation on noisy, incomplete datasets."
