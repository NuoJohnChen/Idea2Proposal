    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a hybrid neural operator architecture (MNO) combining spectral methods and graph attention to solve multiscale PDEs efficiently. It aims to integrate physical constraints and differentiable solvers for improved accuracy, generalization, and interpretability. The experiment plan includes benchmarking on canonical PDEs, molecular dynamics, multiscale materials testing, interpretability analysis, and real-world deployment.",
