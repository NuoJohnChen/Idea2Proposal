    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a unified representation learning framework across vision, audio, and language modalities, addressing the fragmentation in current modality-specific methods. The core hypothesis is that a shared latent space can be learned through a dynamic, modality-agnostic architecture. The proposed method includes modality-agnostic tokenization, dynamic architecture switching, and a cross-modal contrastive objective. The experiment plan is comprehensive, covering tokenization validation, architecture testing, cross-modal alignment, downstream transfer, and efficiency analysis.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Well-articulated problem statement highlighting fragmentation in current representation learning methods.",
        "Innovative proposed method combining modality-agnostic tokenization, dynamic architecture switching, and a cross-modal contrastive objective.",
        "Detailed and comprehensive experiment plan covering multiple aspects of validation."

    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks clear discussion of potential technical challenges, such as designing a truly modality-agnostic tokenizer.",
        "Dynamic architecture switching may introduce significant computational overhead, not adequately addressed.",
        "Cross-modal contrastive objective may face difficulties in aligning highly disparate modalities like audio and text.",

        "What are the expected computational overheads of the dynamic architecture switching mechanism, and how will they be mitigated?",
        "How will the cross-modal contrastive objective ensure meaningful alignment between highly disparate modalities like audio and text?",

    "Limitations": [
        "Potential high computational complexity due to dynamic architecture switching.",
