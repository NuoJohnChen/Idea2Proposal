    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a new framework for AI benchmark design, focusing on bias-aware dataset construction, dynamic benchmarking, and generalization stress testing. It aims to address limitations in current benchmarks through synthetic bias injection, LLM-based adversarial test case generation, and cross-domain evaluation.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement.",
        "Ambitious hypothesis with potential for impact.",
        "Comprehensive three-part framework for benchmark design.",
        "Strong grounding in recent literature.",
        "Systematic experiment plan with multiple steps."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Feasibility concerns, especially with dynamic evaluation and LLM-generated adversarial examples.",
        "Lack of concrete details on controlling synthetic biases and implementing dynamic evaluation.",
        "Validation of new metrics lacks detail.",
        "Potential over-reliance on synthetic data, which may not fully capture real-world complexities.",
        "Limited discussion of baseline comparisons and ablation studies."

    "Questions": [
        "How will the LLM-based test case generator ensure adversarial examples are meaningful and not just noise?",
        "What specific criteria will be used to validate the new composite metrics?",
        "How will the dynamic evaluation protocol scale with increasing model complexity?",
        "How will the synthetic biases be controlled to ensure they are representative of real-world biases?",
        "What safeguards will be in place to prevent the LLM-based test case generator from introducing new biases?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "Dynamic evaluation may be computationally expensive.",
        "Synthetic bias injection may not fully capture real-world biases.",
        "New metrics may require extensive validation to gain adoption.",
        "Potential overfitting to synthetic data, limiting real-world applicability.",
        "Dependence on existing tools may limit the novelty of the proposed framework."
