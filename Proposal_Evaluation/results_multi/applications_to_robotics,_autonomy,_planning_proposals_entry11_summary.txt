Weaknesses: Feasibility of integrating differentiable logic modules with VAEs is unclear and could introduce training instability., Computational overhead of MCTS in real-time applications is not addressed, raising scalability concerns., Scalability of the Bayesian nonparametric model for online adaptation is questionable in high-dimensional state spaces., Lack of discussion on potential failure modes and mitigation strategies is a significant oversight.
