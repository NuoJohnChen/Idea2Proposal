    "Summary": "The proposal seeks to unify metric learning, kernel learning, and sparse coding into a single framework to address their individual limitations. It hypothesizes that combining these methods will yield a more robust and scalable representation learning framework. The proposed method involves adaptive metric-kernel fusion, sparse regularization, and scalable optimization. The experiment plan includes benchmarks on synthetic and standard vision tasks, robustness testing, scalability analysis, and ablation studies.",
