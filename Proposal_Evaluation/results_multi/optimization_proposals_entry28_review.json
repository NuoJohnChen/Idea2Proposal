    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a hybrid optimization framework that dynamically switches between zeroth- and first-order methods based on gradient confidence, aiming to improve efficiency in non-convex and high-dimensional problems. It includes a theoretical convergence analysis and a detailed experimental plan.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Cohesive narrative linking problem statement to proposed solution.",
        "Novel adaptive switching mechanism between zeroth- and first-order methods.",
        "Comprehensive experimental plan with synthetic and real-world benchmarks.",
        "Theoretical convergence framework extending existing work."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Feasibility concerns with gradient confidence estimation using BNNs or dropout.",
        "Potential computational overhead of hybrid updates and subspace projections.",
        "Limited diversity in real-world applications to fully validate scalability.",
        "Lack of discussion on the trade-offs between zeroth- and first-order phases."

        "How will the adaptive threshold for switching between zeroth- and first-order updates be determined?",
        "What are the fallback mechanisms if gradient confidence estimation fails?"

    "Limitations": [
        "Integration of Bayesian neural networks may introduce complexity and computational cost.",
        "Empirical validation of theoretical claims may be non-trivial.",
        "Scalability to very high-dimensional problems is not fully demonstrated."
