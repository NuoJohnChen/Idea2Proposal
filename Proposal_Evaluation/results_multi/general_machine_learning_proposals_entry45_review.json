    "Summary": "The proposal aims to address distribution shift and out-of-distribution generalization in machine learning by combining causal representation learning with self-supervised pretraining. The goal is to develop models that inherently capture invariant features, enabling robust generalization under significant distribution shifts. The method includes a causal representation learning framework, self-supervised pretraining, and adaptive inference mechanisms. The experimental plan involves synthetic benchmarks, real-world domain generalization, ablation studies, scalability tests, and deployment in high-stakes applications.",
