    "Summary": "The proposal aims to bridge the gap between correlation and causation in deep learning by integrating causal discovery with deep representation learning. It proposes a hybrid architecture combining neural networks with modular causal inference layers to learn causally relevant features and infer intervention effects without explicit graph supervision. The experiment plan includes validation of causal disentanglement, benchmarking causal discovery, testing out-of-distribution generalization, evaluating on high-dimensional data, and scaling to language tasks.",
