    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a scalable infrastructure for distributed deep learning (DDL) by optimizing communication and computation in heterogeneous clusters. It addresses inefficiencies in current frameworks through a co-design of adaptive communication protocols and hardware-specific computation pipelines, including hardware-aware workload partitioning, adaptive communication scheduling, and energy-efficient pipeline orchestration. The experiment plan is comprehensive, covering benchmarking, validation, and end-to-end deployment.",
