    "Summary": "The proposal introduces Adaptive Prior-Guided RL (APRL), a novel RL framework that integrates uncertainty-aware dynamics priors, adaptive planning horizon, and hybrid policy optimization to improve sample efficiency and generalization. The method dynamically interpolates between model-based and model-free learning based on model uncertainty.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement highlighting the limitations of current RL methods.",
        "Compelling hypothesis that dynamic interpolation based on uncertainty can mitigate sample inefficiency and error propagation.",
        "Innovative components in the proposed method, including uncertainty-aware dynamics priors and adaptive planning horizon.",
        "Detailed experiment plan with validation, benchmarking, and real-world feasibility testing."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks discussion on the computational overhead of Bayesian neural networks or ensemble methods.",
        "Potential challenges in real-world deployment are not thoroughly addressed.",
        "A more detailed ablation study plan is needed to isolate the contributions of each component."

        "What specific metrics will be used to evaluate the robustness to model mismatch in the benchmarking experiments?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "The proposed method may introduce additional computational complexity due to uncertainty estimation and adaptive planning.",
        "Real-world deployment may face challenges such as sensor noise and environmental variability, which are not fully addressed.",
        "The generalization performance may be limited by the quality and diversity of the offline data used for pretraining."
