    "Summary": "The proposal introduces dynamic, parameter-wise regularization for adaptive gradient methods to address the generalization gap in deep learning. It hypothesizes that dynamic regularization based on parameter importance and training progress can improve generalization while preserving convergence benefits. The method includes dynamic regularization formulation, efficient importance estimation, and theoretical guarantees. The experiment plan covers synthetic benchmarks, deep learning tasks, ablation studies, and theoretical validation.",
