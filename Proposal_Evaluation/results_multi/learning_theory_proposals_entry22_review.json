    "Summary": "The proposal develops a theoretical framework for gradient descent dynamics in non-convex landscapes, focusing on stability. It combines theoretical analysis (Lyapunov theory, Hessian spectra) with empirical validation on synthetic and real-world benchmarks to test if GD implicitly regularizes toward stable minima.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement with well-defined gaps.",
        "Original hypothesis linking stability to GD success.",
        "Comprehensive experiments spanning synthetic and real-world cases.",
        "Strong theoretical foundation with relevant citations.",
        "Balanced theoretical and empirical approach."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Computational challenges (e.g., Hessian spectra in deep nets) need more discussion.",
        "Scalability to high-dimensional spaces is unclear.",
        "Empirical validation could use stronger baselines.",
        "Synthetic landscapes may oversimplify real-world complexity."
