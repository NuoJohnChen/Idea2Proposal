    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a biologically plausible hybrid SNN-Transformer model to bridge computational models of attention with cognitive neuroscience. It integrates dynamic gating, multi-timescale recurrence, and cross-modal predictive coding to better replicate human attentional behavior and neural activity patterns. The validation plan includes biological plausibility tests, dynamic attention simulations, cross-modal integration, clinical relevance assessments, and benchmarking against AI models.",
