    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a hybrid optimization framework combining zeroth- and first-order methods for high-dimensional non-convex problems. It aims to dynamically switch between methods based on local landscape geometry, with components for adaptive switching, gradient-aware updates, and memory efficiency. The experiment plan includes synthetic benchmarks, high-dimensional tasks, real-world problems, ablation studies, and theoretical analysis.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement identifying a gap in existing methods.",
        "Detailed proposed method with three innovative components.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan covering various scenarios.",
        "Cohesive narrative connecting problem, hypothesis, and solution."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Novelty is questionable; hybrid approaches are not new.",
        "Feasibility of seamless integration is overly optimistic.",
        "Theoretical analysis is mentioned but not deeply explored.",
        "Validation plan lacks emphasis on failure modes and edge cases."

        "What are the specific challenges in integrating these methods, and how will they be addressed?",
        "Can you provide more details on the theoretical guarantees and their assumptions?",
        "How will the method handle cases where neither gradients nor zeroth-order updates are reliable?"

    "Limitations": [
        "Potential difficulty in achieving seamless integration of methods.",
        "Scalability in extremely high-dimensional spaces may be limited.",
        "Theoretical guarantees may not hold under practical conditions."
