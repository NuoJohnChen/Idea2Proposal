    "Summary": "The proposal seeks to develop scalable and robust probabilistic inference methods by combining Bayesian techniques with deep learning. It addresses limitations in current methods like MCMC and VI, proposing adaptive MCMC, expressive VI, and uncertainty-aware deep learning. The experiment plan includes benchmarks, evaluations, and real-world applications.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement highlighting limitations of current methods.",
        "Strong motivation with a well-defined hypothesis.",
        "Comprehensive proposed method combining multiple advanced techniques.",
        "Detailed experiment plan with benchmarks, evaluations, and real-world applications."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks depth in discussing potential technical challenges and risks.",
        "Limited emphasis on failure modes and edge cases in the validation plan.",
        "Could benefit from more critical analysis of computational overhead and training instability."
