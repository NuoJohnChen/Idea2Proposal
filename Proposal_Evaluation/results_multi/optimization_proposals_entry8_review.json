    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a dynamic hybrid optimizer for high-dimensional non-convex problems, combining zeroth-order and first-order methods with a gradient reliability-based switching mechanism. It leverages stochastic Lanczos quadrature for reliability estimation and includes synthetic benchmarking, hyperparameter optimization, black-box adversarial attacks, and theoretical analysis.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement identifying gaps in current optimization methods.",
        "Innovative hypothesis proposing dynamic switching based on gradient reliability.",
        "Technically sound method leveraging advanced numerical techniques.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan covering synthetic and real-world benchmarks."
