    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a unified transformer-based architecture for representation learning across vision, audio, and language modalities, using shared weights, modality-specific tokenizers, and cross-modal self-supervision. It aims to create a shared latent space without heavy supervision, leveraging masked autoencoding, contrastive loss, and cross-modal distillation.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Addresses a significant and timely problem in AI: fragmented representation learning across modalities.",
        "Ambitious goal of creating a shared latent space for vision, audio, and language.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan covering modality-specific and cross-modal evaluations.",
        "Well-articulated problem statement and hypothesis.",
        "Innovative proposed method combining modality-agnostic architectures with cross-modal self-supervision."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Scalability concerns: The proposal does not detail how the architecture will handle the computational overhead of mixed-modal training or the memory footprint of shared weights across modalities.",
        "Feasibility of cross-modal distillation: The proposal lacks concrete examples or preliminary results showing how distillation will work in practice, especially for domains with scarce paired data.",
        "Experiment plan lacks granularity: Key steps like pseudo-pair mining and cross-modal distillation are described at a high level without methodological specifics.",
        "Limited discussion of failure modes: The proposal does not address potential pitfalls in aligning fundamentally different modality-specific features or the robustness of pseudo-pair mining."
