    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop neural operators with domain-specific inductive biases to accelerate multiscale simulations in physical sciences. It extends Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) by incorporating physical constraints, hybrid data-physics training, and efficient deployment techniques. The experiment plan includes benchmarking, domain-specific adaptations, and ablation studies.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement highlighting computational limitations of traditional methods and ML approaches.",
        "Ambitious hypothesis integrating domain-specific inductive biases into neural operators.",
        "Detailed proposed method with architecture design, hybrid training, and deployment strategies.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan covering benchmarking, domain adaptations, and ablation studies."
