Decision: Accept
Weaknesses: Lacks specific technical details for some proposed solutions (e.g., sparse approximations, graph coarsening)., Limited discussion of potential failure modes and edge cases in the experimental plan., Scalability solutions are mentioned but not deeply explored in terms of implementation challenges.
