    "Summary": "The proposal aims to enhance interpretability in deep neural networks by developing a hybrid approach that combines topological analysis and gradient-based optimization to create a latent interpretability space. The method includes topological feature scaffolding, gradient-guided disentanglement, and an interactive visualization engine. The experiment plan is comprehensive, covering validation, generalization, causal interpretability, user studies, and computational benchmarking.",
