Weaknesses: Dynamic constraint adaptation may struggle with real-world noise and non-stationary environments., Audit pipeline implementation lacks discussion of computational overhead and false-positive handling., Joint optimization of fairness, safety, and privacy could lead to unstable training dynamics., Longitudinal impact studies depend heavily on external partnerships, introducing uncertainty.
