    "Summary": "The proposal introduces AdaSparseMem, a novel optimizer framework combining dynamic gradient sparsity and memory compression to improve efficiency and generalization in adaptive gradient methods. It targets limitations in current optimizers, such as dense updates and poor generalization, and proposes a unified solution with three key innovations: dynamic gradient sparsity, memory compression, and adaptive hybrid updates. The experiment plan is comprehensive, covering validation, benchmarking, extreme-scale optimization, generalization tests, and hardware efficiency.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement.",
        "Compelling hypothesis combining dynamic sparsity and memory compression.",
