    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a unified framework for robust and interpretable machine learning by combining invariant risk minimization (IRM) with modular architectures and symbolic reasoning. The goal is to improve both robustness to distribution shifts and interpretability without sacrificing performance.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Addresses a timely and important problem in machine learning.",
        "Ambitious integration of multiple advanced techniques (IRM, modular architectures, causal inference).",
        "Well-motivated with clear references to prior work.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan with multiple validation steps."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks detail on how the unified training objective will balance conflicting goals (robustness vs. interpretability).",
        "Potential over-optimism about the feasibility of combining these complex techniques.",
        "Limited discussion of computational costs or scalability challenges.",
        "Human studies for interpretability validation are mentioned but not detailed."
