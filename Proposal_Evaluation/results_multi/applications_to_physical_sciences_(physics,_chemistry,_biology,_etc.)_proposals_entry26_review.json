    "Summary": "The proposal aims to accelerate the discovery of high-temperature superconductors (HTS) by integrating physics-informed feature engineering with advanced machine learning (ML) techniques. It hypothesizes that symmetry-aware descriptors, active learning, and attention-based GNNs can improve predictive accuracy and guide synthesis. The proposed method includes feature engineering, a hybrid active learning loop, and a graph attention network (GAT) architecture. The experiment plan involves benchmarking feature representations, active learning with DFT validation, transferability testing, interpretability analysis, and scalability evaluation.",
