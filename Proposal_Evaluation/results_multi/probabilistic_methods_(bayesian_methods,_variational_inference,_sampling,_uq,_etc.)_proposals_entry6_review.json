    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a hybrid probabilistic inference framework combining variational inference, stochastic gradient MCMC, and uncertainty quantification techniques to bridge Bayesian methods and deep learning. It targets scalability, robustness, and theoretical soundness in uncertainty estimation for large-scale deep learning models.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement highlighting gaps in current probabilistic methods.",
        "Ambitious integration of multiple advanced techniques (VI, SG-MCMC, UQ).",
        "Comprehensive experimental plan covering synthetic, real-world, and large-scale datasets."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Hypothesis is broad and lacks a precise, testable claim.",
        "Execution plan lacks detail on overcoming technical challenges (e.g., scaling adaptive importance sampling).",
        "Experiments are conventional, missing novel stress tests or edge-case evaluations.",
        "Theoretical guarantees are vaguely promised without concrete derivations or assumptions."

    "Questions": [
        "How will adaptive importance sampling scale to high-dimensional spaces?",
        "What specific theoretical guarantees can be derived for the hybrid sampler, and under what assumptions?",
        "How will the framework handle non-stationary or streaming data, which is common in deep learning applications?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "Scalability of structured VI in very high dimensions (e.g., GPT-style models) is unproven.",
        "Hybrid sampling may introduce computational overhead that offsets its theoretical benefits.",
        "Calibration techniques may not generalize across architectures or tasks."
