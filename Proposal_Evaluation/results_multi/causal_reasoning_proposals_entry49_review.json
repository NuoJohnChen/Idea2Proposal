    "Summary": "The proposal introduces DyCoRe, a framework for dynamic causal reasoning in AI, aiming to bridge the gap between correlation and causation using dynamic graph-based models. It targets applications in healthcare, robotics, and high-dimensional domains like vision and language.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement highlighting the limitations of current AI systems in causal reasoning.",
        "Novel hypothesis proposing dynamic causal graphs as a solution, with potential for broad impact.",
        "Comprehensive experimental plan covering synthetic data, healthcare, robotics, and high-dimensional domains.",
        "Explicit focus on scalability and efficiency via sparse attention mechanisms."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Scalability claims lack empirical validation; computational trade-offs are not quantified.",
        "Sparse attention mechanism's robustness in noisy or dense causal graphs is untested.",
        "Baseline comparisons (e.g., PC algorithm, NOTEARS) lack implementation details.",
        "Real-world validation is limited to simulators; no plan for noisy/biased observational data."

        "What hardware/resources are required for real-time dynamic updates in large-scale deployments?",
        "How will the model handle latent confounders or missing data in real-world settings?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "Scalability to real-world graphs (e.g., >10k nodes) is speculative.",
        "Dynamic updates may propagate errors in causal inference.",
        "Over-reliance on synthetic data for initial validation."
