    "Summary": "The proposal introduces Adaptive Prior RL (APRL), a framework to dynamically integrate model-based priors into model-free RL to improve sample efficiency. It leverages uncertainty-aware dynamics learning and adaptive prior weighting to balance exploration and exploitation. The experimental plan includes validation, benchmarking, and ablation studies.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Addresses a critical limitation in RL (sample inefficiency) with a novel approach.",
        "Proposes a dynamic integration of model-based and model-free methods, which is innovative.",
        "Comprehensive experimental plan covering validation, benchmarking, and ablation studies."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks detailed technical specifics on uncertainty-aware dynamics learning and adaptive prior weighting.",
        "Feasibility concerns due to vague implementation details.",
        "Scalability to high-dimensional tasks is not thoroughly explored."
