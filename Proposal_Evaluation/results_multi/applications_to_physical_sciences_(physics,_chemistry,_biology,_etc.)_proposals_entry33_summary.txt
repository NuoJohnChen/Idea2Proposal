Weaknesses: Feasibility concerns regarding the integration of adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) with neural operators., Limited discussion on potential failure modes and limitations., Risk assessment and mitigation strategies could be more detailed., Scalability of attention mechanisms in large-scale systems is not thoroughly addressed., Lack of explicit discussion on computational resource requirements (e.g., GPU memory).
