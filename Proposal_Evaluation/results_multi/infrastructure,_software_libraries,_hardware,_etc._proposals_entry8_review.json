    "Summary": "The proposal aims to optimize heterogeneous computing infrastructure for large-scale ML workloads by co-designing software libraries and hardware-aware scheduling. It includes hardware-aware profiling, a communication-efficient runtime, and framework integration, with a detailed experiment plan covering benchmarking, validation, and real-world deployment.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and relevant problem statement addressing inefficiencies in heterogeneous computing for ML workloads.",
        "Detailed and logical proposed method with a three-part approach (profiling, runtime, framework integration).",
        "Comprehensive experimental plan with multiple stages of validation."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Incremental contribution; builds on existing work without introducing a fundamentally new paradigm.",
        "Execution credibility is moderate; scalability trade-offs and hardware compatibility challenges are not deeply explored.",
        "Scientific rigor could be improved with more critical validation (e.g., ablation studies, stress testing)."

    "Questions": [
        "How will the proposed unified memory abstraction handle devices with vastly different memory hierarchies (e.g., GPUs vs. FPGAs)?",
        "What are the expected overheads of the dynamic profiling and scheduling, and how will they be minimized?",
        "How will the system handle cases where the optimal device placement is not clear-cut or changes dynamically during execution?",
        "What are the fallback mechanisms if the proposed optimizations fail to yield expected improvements?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "Potential scalability issues with very large-scale deployments.",
        "Dependence on vendor-specific tools may limit portability.",
        "Performance gains may be highly dependent on specific workload characteristics.",
        "Real-world deployment may face unforeseen challenges in production environments."
