Weaknesses: Moderate novelty; hierarchical learning and multi-task loss weighting are not entirely new., Lacks depth in addressing technical challenges (e.g., gradient conflicts, computational overhead)., Risks (e.g., negative transfer, scalability) are not thoroughly discussed., Validation plan could benefit from more stress tests (e.g., adversarial robustness, out-of-distribution generalization).
