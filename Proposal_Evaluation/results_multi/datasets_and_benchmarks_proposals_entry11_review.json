    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a dynamic, multi-dimensional benchmarking framework for AI evaluation, addressing limitations of current static benchmarks. It includes dynamic dataset generation, multi-dimensional metrics, and adaptive difficulty scaling to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of AI systems.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement with well-articulated limitations of current benchmarks.",
        "Strong motivation backed by recent literature.",
        "Ambitious and novel approach to benchmarking.",
        "Detailed experiment plan with multiple validation steps."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Technical feasibility of dynamic dataset generation (e.g., ensuring diversity without introducing bias).",
        "Implementation challenges for adaptive difficulty scaling (e.g., meta-learning complexity, computational overhead).",
        "Scalability of human-in-the-loop validation for large-scale deployment.",
        "Standardization of multi-dimensional metrics across diverse tasks."
