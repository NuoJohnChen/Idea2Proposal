    "Summary": "The proposal aims to unify metric learning, kernel learning, and sparse coding into a single framework to address their individual limitations in scalability, robustness, and interpretability. The method involves a joint optimization framework with three components: kernelized metric learning with adaptive sparsity, sparse kernel approximation via Nystr\u00f6m method, and unified optimization via proximal alternating linearization. The experiment plan includes synthetic benchmarking, image retrieval on noisy labels, kernel scalability analysis, interpretability evaluation, and downstream generalization.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement highlighting limitations of existing methods.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan covering multiple aspects of the proposed framework.",
