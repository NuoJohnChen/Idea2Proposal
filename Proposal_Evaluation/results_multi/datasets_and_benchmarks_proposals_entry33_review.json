    "Summary": "The proposal aims to address biases and evaluation gaps in machine learning benchmarks through a three-part framework: dataset auditing and debiasing, controlled perturbation benchmarks, and compositional generalization tasks. It builds on prior work to propose systematic improvements in benchmark reliability.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement with relevant citations.",
        "Strong motivation and hypothesis grounded in existing literature.",
        "Comprehensive proposed method covering multiple aspects of benchmark design.",
        "Detailed experimental plan with specific tasks and datasets."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks detailed technical implementation details for some proposed methods.",
        "Potential challenges and risks are not thoroughly discussed.",
        "Validation strategies could be more rigorous, with clearer success metrics.",
        "Limited discussion on scalability and computational costs."

        "How will the compositional generalization tasks be designed to ensure they are not biased towards specific model architectures?",
        "What steps will be taken to ensure the proposed benchmarks are adopted by the broader research community?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "Potential difficulty in identifying and mitigating all forms of bias in datasets.",
        "Challenges in creating perturbation suites that are both comprehensive and computationally feasible.",
        "Risk of introducing new biases while attempting to remove existing ones.",
