    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a unified representation learning framework integrating unsupervised, self-supervised, semi-supervised, and supervised paradigms through hierarchical feature integration and dynamic gradient routing. It aims to address fragmentation in current methods and improve performance in low-label regimes.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Ambitious and novel hypothesis aiming to unify fragmented paradigms.",
        "Clear problem statement highlighting limitations of current methods.",
        "Detailed method with multi-stage training and adaptive loss weighting.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan with diverse benchmarks and low-resource testing."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Moderate novelty; hierarchical learning and multi-task loss weighting are not entirely new.",
        "Lacks depth in addressing technical challenges (e.g., gradient conflicts, computational overhead).",
        "Risks (e.g., negative transfer, scalability) are not thoroughly discussed.",
        "Validation plan could benefit from more stress tests (e.g., adversarial robustness, out-of-distribution generalization)."

        "How will negative transfer be prevented in cross-modal transfer experiments?",
        "Are there plans to test adversarial robustness or out-of-distribution generalization?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "Potential gradient conflicts between paradigms.",
        "Computational overhead from multi-stage training.",
        "Risk of negative transfer in cross-modal settings.",
