Overall Quality: 7
Argumentative Cohesion: 8
Intellectual Depth: 8
Execution Credibility: 6
Scientific Rigor: 7
Decision: Accept
Weaknesses: Lacks depth in discussing technical challenges (e.g., computational costs, scalability of human-in-the-loop validation)., Execution details (e.g., toolkit implementation, resource requirements) are underdeveloped., Validation plan could explicitly discuss baselines, ablation studies, and failure modes.
