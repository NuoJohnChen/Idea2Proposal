    "Summary": "The proposal aims to unify metric learning, kernel learning, and sparse coding into a single framework to address scalability, computational cost, and robustness issues. The method includes kernelized metric learning with adaptive sparsity, efficient optimization via Nystr\u00f6m approximation, and a unified loss function. The experiment plan covers synthetic data validation, benchmarking, large-scale efficiency analysis, ablation studies, and real-world applications.",
