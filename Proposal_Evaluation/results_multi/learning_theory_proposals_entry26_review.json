    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a theoretical framework for adaptive learning dynamics, addressing limitations of current gradient-based optimizers. It proposes geometry-aware learning dynamics derived from first principles, with a comprehensive experiment plan covering synthetic landscapes, deep networks, invariance tests, and large-scale language modeling.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement.",
        "Ambitious hypothesis proposing geometry-aware learning dynamics.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan covering multiple aspects of the problem.",
        "Strong theoretical ambition with proposed convergence guarantees."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks detailed discussion on computational feasibility of Hessian approximations.",
        "Scalability to very large models is not thoroughly addressed.",
        "Theoretical convergence guarantees may be overly ambitious and challenging to achieve.",
        "Limited discussion on potential technical challenges and risks."
