    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a unified representation learning framework to bridge vision, audio, and language modalities, combining cross-modal distillation, adaptive tokenization, and dynamic gating. It aims to create a shared latent space and includes a detailed experimental plan for validation and deployment.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement highlighting the limitations of current modality-specific methods.",
        "Ambitious and novel hypothesis proposing a hybrid approach for cross-modal alignment.",
        "Detailed proposed method with clear components (cross-modal distillation, adaptive tokenization, dynamic gating).",
        "Comprehensive experimental plan covering validation, scalability, and real-world deployment."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Feasibility concerns due to the complexity of integrating diverse modalities.",
        "Lack of detailed discussion on potential trade-offs in performance across modalities.",
        "Experimental plan may lack depth in addressing scalability and real-world deployment challenges.",
        "Limited evidence of prior work demonstrating the feasibility of such a unified framework."
