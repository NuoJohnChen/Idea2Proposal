    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a unified representation learning framework integrating unsupervised, self-supervised, semi-supervised, and supervised paradigms through a hierarchical objective and adaptive latent space. It aims to dynamically adapt to varying data availability and task requirements, with innovative components like dynamic loss weighting and feature disentanglement. The experiment plan is comprehensive, covering benchmark isolation, large-scale pretraining, and downstream adaptation.",
