Weaknesses: Lack of clarity on how technical challenges (e.g., adversarial training of the critic network) will be addressed., Experimental plan could benefit from more explicit discussion of baseline comparisons and potential pitfalls., Theoretical analysis assumptions (e.g., Lipschitz continuity, bounded task diversity) may not hold in all real-world scenarios., Novelty is incremental; similar ideas have been explored in hierarchical RL and Bayesian optimization., Overly optimistic about stability guarantees and scalability via implicit gradients.
