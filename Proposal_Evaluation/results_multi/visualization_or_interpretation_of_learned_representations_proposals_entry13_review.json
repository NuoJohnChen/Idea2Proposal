    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a framework for visualizing and disentangling learned features in deep neural networks (DNNs) by leveraging latent space geometry. It addresses the opacity of DNN representations and proposes methods for geometry-aware visualization, dynamic disentanglement, and cross-modal validation. The experiments are designed to benchmark existing methods, test the proposed techniques, and validate their interpretability and performance on downstream tasks.",
