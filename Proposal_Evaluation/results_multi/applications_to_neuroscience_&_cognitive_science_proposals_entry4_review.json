    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a hybrid model integrating predictive coding and attractor dynamics to bridge computational models and cognitive neuroscience in decision-making. It includes model development, neural data integration, and behavioral generalization, with a detailed experiment plan.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Ambitious and original hypothesis integrating multiple computational principles.",
        "Clear problem statement highlighting the gap between behavioral models and neural plausibility.",
        "Comprehensive validation plan with multiple experiments and benchmarks.",
        "Potential for broad impact in cognitive neuroscience and computational modeling."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Underestimates technical challenges in model integration and parameter estimation.",
        "Lacks detailed discussion on reconciling mismatches between model predictions and empirical data.",
        "Validation plan needs more critical analyses (e.g., failure modes, boundary conditions).",
        "Ablation studies to isolate predictive coding vs. attractor dynamics are not clearly outlined."

        "What safeguards are in place if Bayesian inference fails to converge on plausible parameters?",
        "Will there be systematic tests to disentangle the contributions of predictive coding and attractor dynamics?",
        "How will fairness in baseline comparisons (e.g., DDMs, RL) be ensured?"

    "Limitations": [
        "High model complexity may lead to overfitting or interpretability issues.",
        "Generalizability across species (human vs. monkey) is uncertain.",
        "Dependence on existing datasets may constrain novel insights."
