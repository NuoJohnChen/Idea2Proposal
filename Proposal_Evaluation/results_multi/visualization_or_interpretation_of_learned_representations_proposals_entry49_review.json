    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a unified framework for interpreting and disentangling learned features in deep neural networks (DNNs) by combining latent-space feature visualization, hierarchical attribution graphs, and causal disentanglement via interventions. The goal is to improve interpretability and trust in DNNs, particularly in critical applications like healthcare and autonomous systems.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Addresses a significant and timely problem in deep learning: interpretability of neural representations.",
        "Well-articulated problem statement and motivation grounded in existing literature.",
        "Innovative integration of multiple techniques (latent-space visualization, hierarchical graphs, causal disentanglement).",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan with validation across multiple domains.",
        "High ambition with potential for broad impact if successful."
