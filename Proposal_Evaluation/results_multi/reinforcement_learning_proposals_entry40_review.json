    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a method for efficient exploration in reinforcement learning using Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC) and uncertainty estimation. It aims to address limitations in current intrinsic motivation methods by providing a more robust measure of novelty and scalability in high-dimensional spaces. The proposal features a clear problem statement, compelling hypothesis, detailed three-part framework, and a comprehensive experiment plan.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement with identified gaps in existing methods.",
        "Compelling hypothesis leveraging CPC for robust novelty measurement.",
        "Detailed three-part framework including contrastive dynamics modeling and uncertainty-aware reward shaping.",
        "Thorough experiment plan covering toy environments, high-dimensional settings, real-world robotics, and theoretical analysis."

    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks detailed discussion on potential technical challenges and mitigation strategies.",
