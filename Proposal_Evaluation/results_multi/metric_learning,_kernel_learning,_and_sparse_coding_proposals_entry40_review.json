    "Summary": "The proposal seeks to unify metric learning, kernel learning, and sparse coding into a single framework to overcome their individual limitations. It hypothesizes that this unification will yield more robust and generalizable representations, especially in low-data regimes. The method involves kernelized metric learning with adaptive sparsity, sparse kernel dictionary learning, and end-to-end optimization. The experiment plan includes synthetic data validation, benchmarking on image retrieval, few-shot learning, anomaly detection, and efficiency/scalability tests.",
