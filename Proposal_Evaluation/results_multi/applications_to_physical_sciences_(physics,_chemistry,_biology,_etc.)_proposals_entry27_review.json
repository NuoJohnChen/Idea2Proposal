    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop neural operators for accelerated simulation of multiscale physical systems, addressing limitations of traditional numerical methods and existing ML approaches. It proposes extending Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) and Graph Neural Operator (GNO) frameworks with domain-specific constraints and a hierarchical training strategy, validated through a detailed experiment plan spanning benchmarking, multiscale validation, domain-specific adaptations, hybrid solver testing, and real-world deployment.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement.",
        "Strong motivation building on recent work in neural operators.",
        "Innovative proposed method with specific architectural extensions.",
        "Detailed and comprehensive experiment plan.",
        "Potential for significant impact in physical sciences."

    "Weaknesses": [
        "Limited discussion of potential technical challenges and risks.",
        "Lack of justification for choosing specific neural operator variants over others.",
        "Uncertainty about the feasibility of integrating domain-specific constraints into neural operators."
