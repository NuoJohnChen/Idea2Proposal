Overall Quality: 7
Argumentative Cohesion: 8
Intellectual Depth: 9
Execution Credibility: 6
Scientific Rigor: 7
Decision: Reject
Weaknesses: Implementation details for core innovations (e.g., learnable kernel parameterization) remain underspecified, No concrete analysis of optimization challenges for joint sparsity/metric learning, Scalability claims lack implementation specifics for distributed training
