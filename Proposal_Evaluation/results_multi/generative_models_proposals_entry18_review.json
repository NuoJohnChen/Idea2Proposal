    "Summary": "The proposal introduces dynamic latent structures into generative models to improve expressivity and efficiency. It targets diffusion models, autoregressive transformers, and hybrid VAEGANs, proposing dynamic noise schedules, sparse attention mechanisms, and adaptive latent spaces. The experiments plan to validate these innovations on standard datasets and downstream tasks.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-motivated problem statement.",
        "Innovative hypothesis proposing dynamic adjustments to latent structures.",
        "Comprehensive experimental plan covering multiple datasets and metrics.",
        "High intellectual depth and ambition, challenging existing paradigms."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Feasibility concerns, especially in scaling to high-resolution data.",
        "Lack of detailed discussion on potential failure modes and alternative approaches.",
        "Overly optimistic assumptions about the integration of multiple dynamic components.",
        "Limited discussion on computational overhead and training stability."

        "How will the hybrid latent space balance the trade-off between stability and expressivity in practice?",
        "What computational resources are required for scaling to high-resolution data, and how will memory usage be managed?"

    "Limitations": [
        "Potential computational overhead from dynamic mechanisms.",
