    "Summary": "The proposal addresses distribution shift and out-of-distribution generalization in machine learning by learning causally invariant features through a stability-aware representation learning framework, automated shift simulation, and an adaptive inference mechanism. The approach is motivated by the limitations of current methods like ERM and IRM, and the experiment plan includes benchmarking on controlled shifts, validating the stability loss, testing on real-world shifts, and conducting ablation studies.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and cohesive narrative from problem statement to proposed solution.",
