Weaknesses: Limited discussion of potential technical challenges and risks in implementing curvature-adaptive layers., Scalability strategies (e.g., hybrid sampling) could benefit from more detailed justification., Lack of explicit mention of computational resources required for large-scale experiments., Feasibility of some components (e.g., hyperbolic attention) is not thoroughly addressed.
