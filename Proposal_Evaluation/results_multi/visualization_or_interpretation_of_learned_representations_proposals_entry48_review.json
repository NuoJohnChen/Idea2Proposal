    "Summary": "The proposal introduces NeuroCartography, a framework for interpretable representation analysis in deep neural networks. It aims to address the opacity of learned representations by combining quantitative interpretability metrics, dynamic feature synthesis, and scalable disentanglement techniques. The work is motivated by the limitations of current visualization and interpretation methods and proposes a hybrid approach to improve fidelity, human-aligned semantics, and disentanglement.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-structured narrative from problem statement to proposed solution.",
        "Strong intellectual depth with a novel hybrid approach to interpretability.",
        "Detailed and credible execution plan with specific steps for each stage of the project.",
        "Relevance and timeliness of the problem addressed, given the growing need for interpretable AI."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Limited discussion of potential biases in human-annotated concepts and crowd-sourcing validation.",
        "Scalability to very large models (e.g., vision transformers) is not thoroughly explored.",
        "Lack of detail on how the proposed methods will handle adversarial or noisy inputs."

        "How will the framework ensure that the synthesized features are not overfitting to the training data?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "Potential biases in human-annotated concepts may affect the validity of interpretability metrics.",
        "Scalability to extremely large models may require additional optimizations not yet proposed.",
        "The framework may struggle with adversarial or noisy inputs, which are common in real-world applications."
