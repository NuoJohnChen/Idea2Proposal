    "Summary": "The proposal aims to improve the reliability and robustness of machine learning benchmarks by addressing dataset biases, introducing dynamic evaluation protocols, and incorporating human-in-the-loop validation. It proposes a three-pronged approach: bias-aware dataset construction, dynamic evaluation protocols, and human-model collaboration metrics. The experiment plan includes quantifying biases in existing benchmarks, developing adversarial splits, testing dynamic evaluation protocols, and conducting human-in-the-loop benchmarking.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Compelling problem statement with concrete examples of dataset biases and evaluation gaps.",
