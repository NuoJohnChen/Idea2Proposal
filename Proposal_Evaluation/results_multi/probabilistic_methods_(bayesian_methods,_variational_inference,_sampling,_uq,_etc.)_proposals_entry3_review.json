    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop scalable and robust probabilistic inference techniques by combining Bayesian methods with deep learning. It addresses limitations in current VI and MCMC methods, proposing adaptive variational families, hybrid MCMC-VI, and uncertainty-aware deep architectures. The experiment plan includes synthetic data, high-dimensional problems, large-scale tasks, and real-world applications.",
