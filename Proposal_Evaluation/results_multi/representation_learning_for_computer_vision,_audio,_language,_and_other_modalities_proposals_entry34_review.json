    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a unified representation learning framework for vision, audio, and language modalities, combining masked prediction and contrastive learning in a shared transformer architecture. The goal is to enable zero-shot cross-modal transfer without paired data supervision. The experiment plan is comprehensive, covering validation, ablation studies, scalability, and comparisons to state-of-the-art models.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and compelling problem statement highlighting fragmentation in current SSL approaches.",
        "Ambitious but plausible hypothesis building on recent SSL advances.",
        "Innovative combination of masked prediction and contrastive learning objectives.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan with detailed validation and comparison strategies."
