Weaknesses: Feasibility of achieving true modality-agnostic learning with a single architecture is uncertain., Lacks detailed discussion of technical hurdles (e.g., tokenization disparities, modality-specific biases)., Validation plan could better emphasize failure modes and boundary conditions., High computational costs and scalability challenges are not thoroughly addressed.
