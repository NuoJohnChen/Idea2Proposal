Intellectual Depth: 6
Execution Credibility: 7
Scientific Rigor: 7
Decision: Accept
Weaknesses: Intellectual depth is incremental; core ideas build on existing work without paradigm-shifting novelty., RL-based scheduling introduces uncertainty regarding training stability, generalization, and overhead., Insufficient discussion of edge cases (e.g., extreme network variability) and failure modes for dynamic protocol switching., Scalability claims lack empirical validation beyond 1,024 GPUs.
