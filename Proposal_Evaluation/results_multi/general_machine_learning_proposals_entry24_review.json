    "Summary": "The proposal aims to improve machine learning model robustness to distribution shifts by leveraging causal invariance and disentangling causal and non-causal features. It proposes a novel regularization framework and a dynamic adaptation mechanism, with validation planned on synthetic and real-world benchmarks.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-motivated problem statement with relevant citations.",
        "Ambitious hypothesis grounded in causal reasoning.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan covering synthetic and real-world benchmarks."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks detailed technical specifics on how causal feature disentanglement will be achieved.",
        "Environment-aware regularization is proposed without clear methods for inferring latent environments.",
        "Experiment plan is somewhat generic, lacking depth in ablation studies and dynamic adaptation testing."

    "Questions": [
        "How exactly will causal feature disentanglement be implemented in the neural architecture?",
        "What self-supervised methods will be used to infer latent environments, and how will their effectiveness be validated?",
        "Can you provide more details on the dynamic adaptation mechanism, including how it avoids catastrophic forgetting?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "The success of the method heavily relies on the ability to accurately disentangle causal and non-causal features, which is non-trivial.",
        "Inferring latent environments without labels may introduce noise and reduce the effectiveness of the regularization.",
        "The dynamic adaptation mechanism may not scale well to very large datasets or high-dimensional feature spaces."
