Weaknesses: Lacks detailed discussion on computational overhead and practical deployment challenges, particularly for hybrid VI-MCMC., Unclear how adversarial calibration will ensure stability under worst-case perturbations without excessive computational cost., Experimental plan could benefit from more rigorous baselines and innovative stress tests to validate robustness., Limited discussion on potential failure modes and alternative approaches if key components (e.g., normalizing flows) fail.
