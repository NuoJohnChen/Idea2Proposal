    "Summary": "The proposal aims to bridge the gap between correlation and causation in neural networks by developing a hybrid framework that integrates causal graph learning, intervention-aware training, and counterfactual prediction. The method combines differentiable DAG learning with variational autoencoders and uses adversarial examples for causal invariance. The experiment plan includes validation on synthetic and real-world datasets, with applications in healthcare and climate science.",
