Execution Credibility: 6
Scientific Rigor: 7
Decision: Accept
Weaknesses: Lacks detailed discussion on technical challenges (e.g., computational overhead, training stability)., Proposed gradient estimation methods may face instability issues., Experimental plan could benefit from more critical analyses (e.g., failure modes, edge cases)., Execution credibility needs stronger justification, particularly for dynamic structures.
