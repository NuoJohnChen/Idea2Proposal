    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a hybrid model combining spiking neural networks (SNNs) and a biologically inspired gating mechanism to bridge the gap between computational models of attention and cognitive neuroscience. It includes validation via synthetic tasks, neural data alignment, clinical applications, and scalability benchmarking.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement highlighting gaps in existing models.",
        "Ambitious hypothesis integrating SNNs and thalamocortical interactions.",
        "Detailed and methodical validation plan, including synthetic tasks, neural data alignment, and clinical applications.",
        "Strong alignment with cognitive neuroscience and potential clinical relevance (e.g., ADHD)."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Feasibility of integrating SNNs with large-scale convolutional backbones is not thoroughly discussed.",
        "Potential technical challenges in real-time adaptation and scalability are understated.",
        "Limited discussion on interpretability challenges when correlating model outputs with fMRI/EEG data.",
        "Ablation studies, while planned, lack detail on how they will isolate specific mechanisms."
