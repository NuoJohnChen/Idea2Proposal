    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a unified framework for interpretable neural representations by combining disentangled feature visualization, concept-based attribution, and a human-AI evaluation protocol. It targets the opacity of deep neural networks by aligning learned features with human-understandable concepts and validating their semantic alignment through behavioral experiments.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Addresses a critical and timely problem in AI interpretability.",
        "Cohesive narrative linking problem, hypothesis, and solution.",
        "Methodologically sound, integrating advanced techniques like StyleGAN-based inversion and Concept Shapley Values.",
        "Rigorous evaluation plan with human-AI benchmarks and case studies.",
        "Ambitious yet grounded in prior work."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Scalability to large-scale models (e.g., transformers) is uncertain.",
        "Generalizability of human-aligned concepts across domains is not fully addressed.",
        "Potential challenges in collecting high-quality human annotations for concepts.",
        "Limited discussion on computational costs and resource requirements."

        "What are the computational costs of the proposed methods, especially for large-scale models?",
        "How will the framework ensure that the discovered concepts are not overfitted to the training data?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "Scalability to very large models (e.g., GPT-4) is untested.",
        "Human annotation quality may vary and introduce bias.",
        "The framework may struggle with highly entangled representations in complex domains."
