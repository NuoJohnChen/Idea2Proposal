    "Summary": "The proposal seeks to bridge computational models of attention with cognitive neuroscience by integrating biologically plausible dynamic attention mechanisms (predictive coding, neuromodulation). It hypothesizes this will better explain neural and behavioral data. The method includes model development, neural data alignment, and behavioral validation, with a detailed step-by-step experiment plan.",
