    "Summary": "The proposal seeks to unify metric learning, kernel learning, and sparse coding into a joint framework to overcome their individual limitations. It hypothesizes that integrating these paradigms will yield adaptable, scalable, and interpretable representations. The method involves metric-aware kernel learning, sparse dictionary learning with kernel embeddings, and end-to-end joint optimization. Experiments include validation of metric-kernel integration, sparse-kernel fusion, end-to-end task performance, scalability analysis, and ablation studies.",
