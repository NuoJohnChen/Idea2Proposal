    "Summary": "The proposal seeks to bridge the theoretical gap in understanding why deep neural networks generalize well, despite being overparameterized. It hypothesizes that generalization is governed by data-dependent optimization dynamics and implicit architectural biases. The authors propose a three-pronged approach: deriving a new data-dependent complexity measure, analyzing implicit bias, and developing a unified framework. The experiment plan includes synthetic and real-world benchmarks, architectural ablations, and optimization dynamics analysis.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Addresses a highly relevant and open problem in deep learning.",
        "Well-motivated hypothesis combining data geometry and optimization dynamics.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan covering synthetic and real-world data.",
        "Ambitious goal of unifying existing partial insights into a coherent framework."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks detailed technical specifics on deriving the new complexity measure.",
        "Experiment plan is somewhat generic and lacks methodological depth.",
        "Proposed unified framework is ambitious but risks being overly optimistic.",
        "Limited discussion of potential technical challenges and mitigation strategies."
