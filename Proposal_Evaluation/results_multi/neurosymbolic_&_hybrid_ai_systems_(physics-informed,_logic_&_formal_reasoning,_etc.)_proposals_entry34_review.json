    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a neurosymbolic hybrid AI framework integrating physics-informed learning with formal reasoning to create robust and interpretable models. It addresses limitations of current hybrid approaches with a three-part framework: physics-informed symbolic layers, neural-symbolic interface, and formal verification modules. The experiment plan includes validation, evaluation, and ablation studies across synthetic and real-world tasks.",
