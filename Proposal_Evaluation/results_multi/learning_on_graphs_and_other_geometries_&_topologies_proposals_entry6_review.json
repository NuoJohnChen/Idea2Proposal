    "Summary": "The proposal aims to extend deep learning to non-Euclidean domains by unifying discrete and continuous geometric representations, addressing scalability, dynamic topologies, and theoretical guarantees in GNNs. It proposes a three-part framework: geometry-aware embeddings, scalable message-passing, and theoretical foundations, with a comprehensive experiment plan covering synthetic, real-world, and theoretical validation.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement.",
        "Strong motivation with a principled approach to unifying discrete and continuous representations.",
        "Detailed and ambitious proposed method with three coherent components.",
        "Thorough experiment plan covering diverse tasks and benchmarks."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks explicit discussion of potential technical challenges and risk mitigation strategies.",
        "Execution credibility could be strengthened with more detailed feasibility analysis.",
        "Novelty of integrating hyperbolic/spherical embeddings with GNNs is somewhat incremental.",
        "Scalability claims for billion-edge graphs lack concrete technical details."
