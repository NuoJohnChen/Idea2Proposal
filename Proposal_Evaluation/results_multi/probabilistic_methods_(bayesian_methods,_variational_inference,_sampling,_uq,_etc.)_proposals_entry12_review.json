    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a unified framework for scalable and robust probabilistic inference by combining adaptive variational inference, gradient-based MCMC, and robust uncertainty quantification. It targets limitations in current Bayesian methods when applied to large-scale deep learning models, focusing on scalability, expressiveness, and reliability of uncertainty estimates.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement identifying key limitations of current probabilistic methods.",
        "Ambitious hypothesis proposing a unified framework that combines adaptive VI, gradient-based MCMC, and robust UQ.",
        "Innovative use of established techniques like normalizing flows, Langevin dynamics, and adversarial calibration.",
        "Comprehensive experimental plan covering synthetic, real-world, and large-scale datasets, with ablation studies."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks detailed discussion on computational overhead and practical deployment challenges, particularly for hybrid VI-MCMC.",
        "Unclear how adversarial calibration will ensure stability under worst-case perturbations without excessive computational cost.",
        "Experimental plan could benefit from more rigorous baselines and innovative stress tests to validate robustness.",
        "Limited discussion on potential failure modes and alternative approaches if key components (e.g., normalizing flows) fail."

    "Questions": [
        "How will the computational overhead of the hybrid VI-MCMC approach be managed in practice, especially for high-dimensional data?",
        "What specific metrics and stress tests will be used to evaluate the robustness of adversarial calibration?",
        "What are the fallback strategies if the hybrid VI-MCMC sampler fails to converge or encounters mode collapse?",
        "How will the proposed framework handle cases where normalizing flows fail to approximate the true posterior adequately?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "Potential high computational cost due to the integration of multiple complex components (VI, MCMC, UQ).",
        "Risk of instability or overfitting in adversarial calibration scenarios without proper regularization.",
        "Scalability to extremely high-dimensional data or very large models (e.g., GPT-3) remains uncertain.",
        "Dependence on hyperparameter tuning for normalizing flows and Langevin dynamics."
