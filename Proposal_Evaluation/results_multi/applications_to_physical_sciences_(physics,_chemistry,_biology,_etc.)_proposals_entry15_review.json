    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a Multiscale Neural Operator (MNO) framework to address limitations in current neural operators for multiscale PDE simulations. It combines adaptive resolution mechanisms and hierarchical attention to improve generalization and efficiency across varying boundary conditions and domain geometries. The method is validated on synthetic PDEs, turbulence modeling, crack propagation, protein folding, and reaction-diffusion systems.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement identifying gaps in existing methods.",
        "Ambitious hypothesis with innovative components (adaptive kernel integration, hierarchical attention, geometry-aware embeddings).",
        "Detailed experiment plan covering a wide range of applications.",
        "Rigorous validation plan with multiple metrics and ablation studies."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks thorough discussion of potential technical challenges (e.g., computational overhead of adaptive resolution).",
        "Scalability of hierarchical attention is not fully addressed.",
        "Execution details for geometry-aware embeddings are vague.",
        "Baseline comparisons could be more explicitly detailed."
