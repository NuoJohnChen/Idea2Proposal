    "Summary": "The proposal introduces dynamic latent manifolds (DLMs) to improve generative models by adaptively adjusting the latent space geometry. It aims to balance sample quality and diversity while maintaining efficient sampling. The method includes manifold dynamics, efficient sampling via geodesic flow, and a stabilized training objective. The experimental plan validates manifold adaptivity, benchmarks sampling speed, evaluates downstream quality, analyzes latent geometry, and scales to high-resolution data.",
