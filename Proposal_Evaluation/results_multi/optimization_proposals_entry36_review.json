    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a hybrid optimization method combining zeroth- and first-order techniques for non-smooth objectives, with a dynamic switching mechanism based on local geometry. It aims to improve convergence and generalization by leveraging gradient-guided zeroth-order updates and memory-efficient optimization. The experiment plan includes synthetic benchmarks, real-world applications, and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement highlighting limitations of existing methods.",
        "Intriguing hypothesis proposing dynamic switching based on local geometry.",

    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lack of detailed technical specifics on the switching mechanism.",
        "Unclear implementation of the probabilistic model for gradient uncertainty estimation.",
        "Execution credibility is somewhat undermined by insufficient technical depth.",
        "Experiment plan could benefit from more rigorous statistical validation methods."
