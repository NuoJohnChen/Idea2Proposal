    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a hierarchical RL framework that adaptively integrates model-based priors using uncertainty-aware model ensembles and a transformer-based gating mechanism. The goal is to improve sample efficiency while maintaining robustness to model bias. The framework combines uncertainty-aware model learning, adaptive gating, and hierarchical policy optimization.",
    "Strengths": [
