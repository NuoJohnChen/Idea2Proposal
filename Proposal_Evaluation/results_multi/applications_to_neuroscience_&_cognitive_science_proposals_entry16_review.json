    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a biologically inspired computational model of attention, integrating dynamic gating, hierarchical predictive coding, and efficient resource allocation to bridge the gap between computational models and cognitive neuroscience. The model will be validated against neural data, behavioral benchmarks, and clinical relevance.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and compelling problem statement highlighting a significant gap in current models.",
        "Ambitious hypothesis integrating computational efficiency and neuroscientific plausibility.",
        "Comprehensive validation plan including neural data, behavioral benchmarking, and clinical relevance."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lack of detailed technical specifics on implementing dynamic gating and predictive coding.",
        "Execution plan appears overly optimistic, especially in aligning model dynamics with neural data.",
        "Limited discussion on potential technical challenges and risk mitigation strategies."
