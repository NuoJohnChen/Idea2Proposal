    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a novel framework for generative models using dynamic latent manifolds to improve controllability and sample quality. It leverages Riemannian geometry and proposes a three-part method involving dynamic manifold learning, geodesic sampling/editing, and efficient training via surrogate losses. The experimental plan includes validation on synthetic data, image data, video generation, and theoretical analysis.",
