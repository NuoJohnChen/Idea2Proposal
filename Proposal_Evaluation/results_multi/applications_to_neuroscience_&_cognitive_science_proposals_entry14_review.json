    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a biologically constrained spiking neural network (SNN) model to bridge computational models and cognitive neuroscience in understanding decision-making. It hypothesizes that a unified SNN model incorporating synaptic plasticity and neuromodulation can replicate behavioral and neural data across species and clinical applications. The validation plan is comprehensive, spanning cross-species data and clinical translation.",
