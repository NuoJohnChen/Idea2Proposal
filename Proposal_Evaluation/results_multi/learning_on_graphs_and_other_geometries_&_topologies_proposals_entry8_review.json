    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a geometry-agnostic equivariant framework for deep learning that unifies handling of graphs, manifolds, and other non-Euclidean data structures. It combines geometric scattering transforms, learnable differential operators, and topology-aware attention mechanisms to address limitations in current GNNs regarding generalization and geometric feature handling.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear articulation of fundamental limitations in current geometric deep learning methods",
        "Ambitious and theoretically grounded hypothesis about equivariance as a unifying principle",
        "Novel combination of advanced mathematical techniques (geometric scattering, differential operators)",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan covering synthetic validation, real-world benchmarks, and ablation studies",
        "Strong potential impact across multiple application domains if successful"
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lack of detailed discussion on integration challenges between discrete and continuous geometric representations",
        "Limited consideration of computational complexity tradeoffs in the unified framework",
        "Experiment plan could better stress-test the unified aspect across fundamentally different geometries",
        "Minimal discussion of failure modes or limitations of the proposed unified approach"

        "What would constitute failure of the unified approach, and how would you diagnose it?"

    "Limitations": [
        "Potential computational overhead from maintaining equivariance across diverse geometries",
        "Risk of over-engineering when specialized architectures might suffice for specific domains",
