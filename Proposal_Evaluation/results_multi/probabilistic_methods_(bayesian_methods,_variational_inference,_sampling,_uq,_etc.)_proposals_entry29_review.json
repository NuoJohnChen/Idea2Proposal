    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop scalable and robust probabilistic inference methods by combining adaptive variational inference, stochastic gradient MCMC, and deep learning integration. The goal is to address the limitations of current Bayesian methods in high-dimensional, non-linear models.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement highlighting the limitations of current probabilistic methods.",
        "Strong motivation and hypothesis that adaptive variational families and improved MCMC techniques can address scalability and flexibility issues.",
        "Ambitious proposed method combining normalizing flows, SG-MCMC, and deep learning integration.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan including synthetic data benchmarks, high-dimensional models, and real-world applications."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lack of detailed implementation specifics for the hybrid framework.",
        "Insufficient discussion of potential risks and challenges in integrating these methods.",
        "Validation plan could be more rigorous, especially in terms of ablation studies and comparison to baselines.",
        "Limited discussion on computational resources and feasibility of large-scale experiments."
