    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a unified framework for co-optimizing fairness, safety, and privacy in AI systems, addressing the current fragmentation in these areas. It proposes a dynamic trade-off mitigation mechanism through a three-part framework involving unified metric design, adaptive constraint enforcement, and a modular architecture. The experiment plan includes benchmarking, validation, testing, full-system evaluation, and real-world deployment.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and compelling problem statement highlighting a critical gap in AI research.",
        "Ambitious and novel hypothesis proposing dynamic trade-off mitigation.",
        "Detailed proposed method with a three-part framework.",
        "Thorough experiment plan covering multiple stages from benchmarking to real-world deployment."
