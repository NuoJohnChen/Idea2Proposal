    "Summary": "The proposal aims to integrate meta-learning and lifelong learning to create adaptive AI systems capable of continual learning. It identifies gaps in current methods and proposes a unified framework with memory-augmented meta-learning, interference-aware optimization, and a scalable architecture. The experiment plan includes benchmarks, memory mechanisms, cross-domain transfer, adaptation speed, and real-world deployment.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement identifying gaps in current methods.",
        "Ambitious hypothesis proposing a unified framework.",
        "Detailed proposed method incorporating memory-augmented meta-learning and interference-aware optimization.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan covering multiple aspects of continual learning."
