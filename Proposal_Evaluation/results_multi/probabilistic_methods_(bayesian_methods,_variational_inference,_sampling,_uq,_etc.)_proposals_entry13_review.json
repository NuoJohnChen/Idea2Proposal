    "Summary": "The proposal seeks to develop a unified framework for scalable and robust probabilistic inference by integrating Bayesian methods with deep learning. It addresses challenges in variational inference, MCMC, and uncertainty quantification, proposing structured VI, adaptive MCMC, and UQ integration. The experiment plan includes synthetic data evaluation, benchmarking, scaling to deep models, real-world applications, and ablation studies.",
