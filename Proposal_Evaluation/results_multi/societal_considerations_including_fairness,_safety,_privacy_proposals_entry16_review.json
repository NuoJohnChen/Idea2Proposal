    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a framework to jointly optimize fairness, safety, and privacy in AI systems, addressing their interdependencies and trade-offs. It includes a unified metric design, adaptive constraint balancing, and formal verification, with a detailed experiment plan involving benchmark studies, real-world deployment, and longitudinal impact assessment.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Addresses a critical and timely issue in AI systems.",
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement.",
        "Strong motivation and hypothesis about the interdependence of fairness, safety, and privacy.",
        "Ambitious and comprehensive proposed method.",
        "Detailed and credible experiment plan, including real-world deployment."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Feasibility concerns about integrating all three constraints without significant trade-offs.",
        "Limited discussion on potential limitations and risks.",
        "Execution credibility is uncertain due to the complexity of the proposed framework."
