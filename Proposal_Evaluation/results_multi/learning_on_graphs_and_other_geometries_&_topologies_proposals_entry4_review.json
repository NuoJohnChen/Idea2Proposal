    "Summary": "The proposal aims to unify neural architectures for non-Euclidean data through geometric deep learning, addressing limitations in expressive power, over-smoothing, and geometric generalization. It proposes a method combining geometric message passing, expressive architectures, and scalable optimization, with a detailed experiment plan covering validation, generalization, mitigation, scalability, and applications.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement",
        "Ambitious and original hypothesis grounded in recent literature",
