    "Summary": "The proposal introduces FlexDist, a scalable infrastructure for distributed deep learning, aiming to optimize communication and computation in heterogeneous clusters. It addresses inefficiencies in current frameworks by proposing a dynamic task scheduler, adaptive communication layer, and fault tolerance mechanisms. The experiment plan includes benchmarking, validation, and ablation studies.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement.",
        "Strong motivation with a clear hypothesis.",
        "Innovative combination of dynamic task scheduling, adaptive communication, and fault tolerance.",
        "Detailed and comprehensive experiment plan."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Feasibility concerns regarding the integration of RL-based protocol switcher and gradient compression.",
        "Lack of detailed discussion on potential challenges in implementing dynamic scheduling and RL-based switcher.",
        "Scalability to 512 nodes is ambitious and may face significant technical hurdles.",
        "Limited discussion on the overhead of dynamic scheduling and its impact on performance."
