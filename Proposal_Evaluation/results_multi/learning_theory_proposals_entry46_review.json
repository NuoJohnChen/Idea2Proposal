    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a theoretical framework for adaptive learning dynamics in non-convex optimization, focusing on gradient descent in deep learning. It hypothesizes that gradient trajectories can be decomposed into adaptive phases governed by loss landscape curvature, and proposes a method combining dynamical systems theory, random matrix theory, and adaptive optimizer design. The experiment plan includes empirical phase identification, theoretical validation, benchmarking an adaptive optimizer, generalization analysis, and scalability tests.",
