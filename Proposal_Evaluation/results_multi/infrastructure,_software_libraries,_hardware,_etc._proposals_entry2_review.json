    "Summary": "The proposal aims to optimize distributed training infrastructure for large-scale AI models through a hardware-software co-design approach. It identifies critical bottlenecks in current frameworks and proposes solutions involving topology-aware scheduling, unified memory management, and compiler-driven optimizations. The experiment plan includes benchmarking, evaluation, and end-to-end training efficiency tests.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement.",
        "Strong motivation and hypothesis centered around hardware-software co-design.",
        "Detailed proposed method with multiple components targeting communication, memory, and kernel optimization.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan covering benchmarking, evaluation, and end-to-end training efficiency."
