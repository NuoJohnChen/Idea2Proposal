    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a hybrid RNN-attention model to bridge computational models and cognitive neuroscience, focusing on dynamic attentional control. It outlines a detailed architecture, neural data integration, and validation framework, including synthetic tasks, fMRI data, and NHP electrophysiology.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement highlighting gaps in current models and neuroimaging tools.",
        "Ambitious hypothesis proposing a biologically plausible model for dynamic attentional control.",
        "Detailed method with a clear architecture and comprehensive validation framework.",
        "Robust validation plan including classical models, behavioral data, and multiple neural data types."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Execution plan lacks depth in addressing technical challenges (e.g., integrating disparate neural data types).",
        "Overpromises on feasibility without detailed risk mitigation strategies.",
        "Validation framework could benefit from more rigorous baseline comparisons and ablation studies.",
        "Limited discussion on model interpretability and potential failure modes."

    "Questions": [
        "How will the model handle discrepancies between fMRI and electrophysiology data, given their differing temporal and spatial resolutions?",
        "What are the specific technical challenges in integrating the proposed gating mechanisms, and how will they be addressed?",
        "How will the model's performance be compared to state-of-the-art baselines in a fair and rigorous manner?",
        "What are the boundary conditions or failure modes of the proposed model?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "Potential difficulty in integrating disparate neural data types (fMRI, EEG, single-unit recordings).",
        "Model complexity may hinder interpretability and generalizability.",
        "Reliance on existing datasets may limit validation scope and introduce noise or bias."
