    "Summary": "The proposal aims to improve the interpretability of deep neural networks by combining disentanglement techniques, human-in-the-loop annotation, and interactive visualization. It proposes a hybrid approach to quantify interpretability, disentangle features, and link them to human-understandable concepts. The experiment plan includes validation on synthetic and real-world datasets, user studies, and downstream task evaluation.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement.",
        "Ambitious hypothesis proposing a novel hybrid approach.",
        "Detailed proposed method with three distinct components.",
        "Comprehensive step-by-step experiment plan with synthetic and real-world validation."

    "Weaknesses": [
        "Feasibility concerns with the human-in-the-loop component and scalability.",
        "Limited discussion on potential pitfalls and alternative approaches.",
        "Lack of detail on how the interactive visualization tool will be implemented and evaluated.",
