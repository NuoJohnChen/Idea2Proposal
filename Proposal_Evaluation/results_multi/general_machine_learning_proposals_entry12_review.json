    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a unified and efficient general-purpose machine learning model using adaptive computation. It combines dynamic computation graphs, unified representation learning, and hardware-aware optimization to address the limitations of current specialized models. The experimental plan includes validation of dynamic routing, multi-modal generalization tests, efficiency benchmarks, and downstream transfer evaluations.",
