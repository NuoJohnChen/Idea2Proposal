    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a landscape-aware adaptation mechanism for adaptive gradient methods, dynamically adjusting EMA decay rates based on local gradient statistics and curvature estimates. It includes non-stationarity detection, sparsity-aware updates, and curvature-corrected step sizes. The experiment plan covers synthetic benchmarks, deep learning ablations, large-scale sparse tasks, generalization analysis, and theoretical analysis.",
