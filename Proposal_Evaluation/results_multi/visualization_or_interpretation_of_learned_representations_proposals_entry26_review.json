    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a unified framework for interpreting neural networks by combining disentanglement and intervention-based probing to reveal causal structures in learned representations. It includes a quantitative interpretability framework, architecture-agnostic visualization tools, and interpretability-by-design training methods. The experiment plan is comprehensive, covering benchmarking, validation, robustness testing, cross-modal transfer, and real-world deployment.",
