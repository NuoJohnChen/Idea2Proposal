    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a differentiable neurosymbolic layer that integrates neural networks and symbolic reasoning, addressing limitations in current hybrid AI systems. It proposes a unified framework with three main components: a differentiable symbolic compiler, neurosymbolic latent alignment, and hybrid optimization. The experiment plan includes validation on synthetic tasks, real-world applications, ablation studies, scalability analysis, and interpretability evaluation.",
