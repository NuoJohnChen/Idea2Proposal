    "Summary": "The proposal seeks to develop a unified theoretical framework for understanding generalization in deep neural networks by combining algorithm-dependent stability and data-dependent structural complexity. It includes theoretical extensions, new complexity measures, and empirical validation on synthetic and real-world datasets.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement.",
        "Strong motivation and hypothesis combining stability and structural complexity.",
        "Ambitious and comprehensive proposed method.",
        "Detailed step-by-step experiment plan."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Execution plan may be overly optimistic given the complexity of the problem.",
        "Lacks discussion of potential pitfalls and alternative approaches.",
        "Feasibility of deriving meaningful bounds for deep nonlinear architectures is uncertain."

    "Questions": [
        "What are the specific technical challenges in extending the stability framework to account for feature adaptation?",
        "How will the proposed complexity measures handle the high-dimensional and nonlinear nature of deep neural networks?",
        "What alternative approaches will be considered if the hypothesized framework does not hold?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "Theoretical derivations may not yield tight or interpretable bounds.",
        "Empirical validation may not fully capture the complexity of real-world scenarios.",
        "Potential over-reliance on synthetic data for grounding the theory."
