    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a unified representation learning framework for vision, audio, and language modalities. It identifies the limitations of current modality-specific approaches and proposes a hybrid architecture with adaptive tokenization, modality-aware transformers, and a multi-task pretraining objective. The experiment plan includes validation, benchmarking, pretraining, and downstream evaluation.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Ambitious and timely research question addressing a significant gap in multimodal learning.",
        "Clear problem statement and well-articulated motivation.",
        "Detailed proposed method with innovative components like adaptive tokenization and modality-aware gating.",
