    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a unified representation learning framework across vision, audio, and language modalities, aiming to overcome the limitations of current modality-specific approaches. It proposes a shared latent space with modality-agnostic feature extraction, combining masked reconstruction, contrastive learning, and modality-invariant regularization. The experiment plan includes validation, cross-modal alignment, zero-shot transfer, scalability analysis, and ablation studies.",
    "Strengths": [
