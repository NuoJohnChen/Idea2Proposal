    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a universal geometric deep learning framework to address limitations in GNNs, such as expressivity, scalability, and generalization across topologies. It leverages geometric priors, hierarchical sparsification, and geometric attention to create a unified approach for non-Euclidean data.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-motivated problem statement with references to recent literature.",
        "Ambitious and theoretically grounded hypothesis leveraging geometric priors.",
        "Comprehensive proposed method combining multiple advanced techniques.",
        "Thorough experiment plan covering synthetic tasks, scalability benchmarks, and downstream applications."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Feasibility of integrating diverse techniques into a single framework is not fully addressed.",
        "Lacks detailed discussion on potential technical challenges and risk mitigation strategies.",
        "Computational overhead of persistent homology and trade-offs in learnable coarsening are not explored."
