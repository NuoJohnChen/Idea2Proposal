    "Summary": "The proposal aims to unify metric learning, kernel learning, and sparse coding into a single framework for robust representation learning. It hypothesizes that integrating these methods can overcome their individual weaknesses, leading to more scalable, interpretable, and semantically coherent representations. The proposed method involves kernelized metric learning with adaptive basis, sparse coding with metric-guided regularization, and an ADMM-based optimization algorithm. The experiment plan includes synthetic validation, benchmarking, scalability analysis, interpretability studies, and downstream task evaluation.",
