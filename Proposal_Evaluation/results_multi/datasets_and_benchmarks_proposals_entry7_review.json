    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a dynamic, multimodal, and task-agnostic benchmarking framework for AI evaluation, aiming to address the limitations of current static, narrow-modality, and task-specific benchmarks. It hypothesizes that such a framework can provide a more accurate and comprehensive evaluation of AI systems.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement with relevant citations.",
        "Compelling hypothesis that addresses significant gaps in AI evaluation.",
        "Ambitious and innovative approach with potential for broad impact.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan with multiple validation steps."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lack of detailed technical implementation for dynamic benchmark construction and task-agnostic evaluation.",
        "Feasibility concerns, particularly regarding scalability and computational costs.",
        "Overly optimistic assumptions about collaboration with industry partners and real-world deployment.",
        "Validation plan could benefit from more critical analyses, such as ablation studies and stress tests."

    "Questions": [
        "How will the dynamic benchmark construction be implemented technically, and what are the specific methodologies for the 'task soup' protocol?",
        "What strategies will be employed to mitigate scalability and computational cost issues?",
        "How will potential biases in human-in-the-loop techniques be addressed?",
        "What contingency plans are in place if industry collaboration for real-world validation is not secured?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "Scalability of dynamic benchmarking may be limited by computational and human resource constraints.",
        "Integration of multimodal tasks may introduce complexity and potential biases.",
        "Real-world deployment validation is contingent on industry partnerships, which may not be secured."
