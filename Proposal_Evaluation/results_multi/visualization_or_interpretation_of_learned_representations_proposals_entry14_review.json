    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a unified framework for visualizing and disentangling learned features in deep neural networks using neural dictionary learning, cross-modal concept alignment, and dynamic hierarchical visualization. It addresses the interpretability gap in current methods and includes a comprehensive experimental plan.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement highlighting limitations of current interpretability methods.",
        "Ambitious hypothesis suggesting hierarchical, disentangled features in DNNs.",
        "Comprehensive experimental plan covering synthetic data, vision models, and language models.",
        "Potential for broad impact given the importance of interpretability in DNNs."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks detailed discussion on scalability to large models like GPT-3.",
        "No clear risk mitigation strategies for potential technical challenges.",
        "Validation plan could benefit from more rigorous ablation studies.",
        "Human evaluations via Mechanical Turk may introduce bias and variability."

        "What are the potential failure modes of the NMF-based approach, and how will they be addressed?",
        "How will the human evaluations be standardized to ensure consistency and reduce bias?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "Scalability to very large models may be limited by computational resources.",
        "The NMF-based approach may not capture all relevant features in complex datasets.",
        "Human evaluations may not fully capture the interpretability of learned concepts."
