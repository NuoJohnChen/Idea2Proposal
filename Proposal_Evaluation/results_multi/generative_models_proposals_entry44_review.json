    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a framework for generative models with dynamic latent structures to address the trade-off between expressivity and efficiency. It combines input-dependent latent allocation, hierarchical latent refinement, and efficient dynamic computation to improve sampling efficiency and expressivity across various data modalities.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-motivated problem statement",
        "Compelling hypothesis grounded in theoretical understanding",
        "Novel combination of advanced techniques (gating mechanisms, hierarchical VAEs, latent sparsification)",
        "Thorough experiment plan covering multiple modalities and detailed ablation studies",
        "Potential for significant impact on generative modeling"
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks detailed discussion of technical implementation challenges",
        "Insufficient risk analysis regarding training stability and gradient estimation",
        "Baseline selection and fairness could be more explicitly addressed",
        "Execution details for dynamic latent structures are somewhat vague"
