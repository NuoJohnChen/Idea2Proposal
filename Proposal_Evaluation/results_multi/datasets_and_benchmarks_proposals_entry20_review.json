    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a three-part framework (adversarial dataset construction, dynamic task generation, cross-domain evaluation) to address biases and robustness issues in machine learning benchmarks. It aims to develop a scalable, reproducible benchmark suite that tests model robustness and generalization across domains.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Well-articulated problem statement with strong motivation and relevant literature citations.",
        "Comprehensive proposed method that builds on existing work, suggesting a credible approach.",
        "Detailed experiment plan with clear steps to evaluate model robustness and generalization.",
        "High potential for impact by improving benchmark quality and reliability."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks specificity in addressing technical challenges (e.g., scalability of dynamic task generation).",
        "Limited discussion on computational costs and generalizability across domains.",
        "Integration with existing pipelines (e.g., MLPerf) is mentioned but not thoroughly explored."
