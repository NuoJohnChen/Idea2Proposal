    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop neurosymbolic and hybrid AI systems that integrate physics-informed learning with logic and formal reasoning. It addresses the trade-off between the scalability of deep learning and the interpretability of symbolic methods by proposing a three-part framework: physics-informed symbolic constraints, differentiable logic for neurosymbolic learning, and dynamic hybrid architectures. The experiment plan includes validation tasks in fluid dynamics, synthetic reasoning, robotics, molecular design, and scientific datasets.",
