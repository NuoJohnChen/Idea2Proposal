Weaknesses: Feasibility concerns regarding the practical implementation of wavelet transforms for gradient decomposition., Lack of discussion on computational overhead and scalability., Uncertainty about the auxiliary network's performance for predicting gradient significance., Limited real-world benchmarks; relies heavily on synthetic and simulated scenarios., Theoretical analysis appears overly optimistic given the complexity of non-stationary optimization.
