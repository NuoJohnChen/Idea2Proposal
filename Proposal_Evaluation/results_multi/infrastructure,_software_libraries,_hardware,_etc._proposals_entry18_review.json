    "Summary": "The proposal aims to optimize distributed training infrastructure for large-scale AI models through a hardware-software co-design approach. It identifies inefficiencies in current frameworks and proposes three main innovations: topology-aware communication primitives, compiler-driven memory optimization, and hardware-accelerated scheduling. The experimental plan is comprehensive, focusing on benchmarking, validation, and end-to-end efficiency analysis.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Addresses a critical and timely problem in AI model training.",
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement and motivation.",
        "Innovative components like topology-aware communication primitives and compiler-driven memory optimization.",
        "Comprehensive experimental plan with detailed steps."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Feasibility of some components (e.g., memory defragmentation) is not thoroughly discussed.",
        "Experimental plan lacks depth in addressing potential failure modes or edge cases.",
        "Limited discussion on how to handle hardware heterogeneity in practice.",
        "Scalability beyond 1K GPUs is uncertain."

        "What are the fallback mechanisms if the topology-aware communication primitives fail to adapt in real-time?",
        "How will the system handle extreme cases of hardware heterogeneity (e.g., vastly different GPU generations in the same cluster)?",
        "What are the potential overheads of implementing JIT memory allocation and dynamic scheduling?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "Potential scalability issues beyond 1K GPUs.",
        "Dependence on specific hardware features (e.g., NVLink) may limit generalizability.",
        "Complexity of integrating multiple optimizations may introduce unforeseen bottlenecks.",
