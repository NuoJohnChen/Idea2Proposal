    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a unified representation learning framework across vision, audio, and language modalities, addressing the fragmentation in current modality-specific approaches. It proposes a modality-agnostic architecture with adaptive feature extractors and a shared latent space, leveraging dynamic gating mechanisms and hierarchical attention for cross-modal transfer and zero-shot generalization. The experimental plan is comprehensive, covering validation, cross-modal transfer, scalability, and generalization.",
    "Strengths": [

        "Potential complexity in scaling the architecture to handle multiple modalities simultaneously.",
