    "Summary": "The proposal aims to advance geometric deep learning by integrating geometric and topological priors into neural architectures for non-Euclidean domains. It addresses limitations of existing GNNs through a three-pronged approach: Geometric Graph Networks, Topological Regularization, and Multi-Scale Geometric Architectures. The experimental plan includes synthetic and real-world benchmarks to validate the proposed methods.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement with strong grounding in recent literature.",
        "Ambitious and multi-faceted approach addressing key limitations of existing GNNs.",
        "Comprehensive experimental validation plan with diverse benchmarks and applications.",
        "Strong intellectual depth and originality in integrating geometric and topological priors."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Execution plan may be overly ambitious given the breadth of proposed innovations.",
        "Lacks explicit discussion of potential pitfalls and alternative approaches if hypotheses fail.",
        "Limited discussion on computational resources and feasibility of large-scale experiments."

    "Questions": [
        "How will the proposed methods handle cases where geometric or topological priors are not readily available or difficult to compute?",
        "What are the expected computational costs of the proposed curvature-aware layers and topological regularization?",
        "Are there any fallback strategies if the proposed multi-scale architectures do not scale as expected?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "Complexity of integrating multiple novel components (geometric, topological, multi-scale) may lead to unforeseen technical challenges.",
        "Potential over-reliance on synthetic datasets for initial validation may not fully capture real-world complexities.",
        "Scalability of the proposed methods on very large graphs (e.g., social networks) remains to be demonstrated."
