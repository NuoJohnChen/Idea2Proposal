Weaknesses: Scalability claims lack empirical validation; computational trade-offs are not quantified., Sparse attention mechanism's robustness in noisy or dense causal graphs is untested., Baseline comparisons (e.g., PC algorithm, NOTEARS) lack implementation details., Real-world validation is limited to simulators; no plan for noisy/biased observational data.
