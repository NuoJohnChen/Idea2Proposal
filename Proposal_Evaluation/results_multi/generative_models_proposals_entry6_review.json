    "Summary": "The proposal addresses the challenge of high-fidelity 3D content synthesis by combining diffusion models and graph neural networks. It hypothesizes that a hybrid architecture can overcome scalability and realism issues in current methods. The proposed method includes geometric-aware diffusion, hierarchical graph-based sampling, and differentiable rendering for adversarial feedback. The experiment plan involves validating geometric equivariance, testing hierarchical sampling, benchmarking against state-of-the-art, assessing realism, and conducting ablation studies.",
