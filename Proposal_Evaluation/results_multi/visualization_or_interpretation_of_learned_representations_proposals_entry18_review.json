    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a unified framework for interpreting deep neural networks by combining hierarchical feature graphs, geometry-aware disentanglement, and unsupervised concept discovery. It aims to address limitations in current interpretability methods, particularly in capturing hierarchical feature interactions and disentangling semantic concepts.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement.",
        "Strong motivation and hypothesis that bridges top-down and bottom-up approaches.",
        "Ambitious and intellectually deep proposed method leveraging advanced techniques.",
        "Rigorous validation plan with multiple benchmarks and real-world deployment."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Execution plan may be overly optimistic given the complexity of modern architectures.",
        "Lacks discussion on computational feasibility and scalability, especially for large models like GPT-3.",
        "Potential technical challenges in implementing Riemannian metric learning and concept autoencoders at scale."
