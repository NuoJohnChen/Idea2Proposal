    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a systematic framework for interpreting and visualizing learned representations in deep neural networks by combining topological data analysis (TDA), gradient-based attribution, and attention decoding. It targets both CNNs and transformers, focusing on dynamic manifold visualization, gradient-guided disentanglement, and cross-architecture attention decoding to address the interpretability gap.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement.",
        "Strong motivation and hypothesis building on recent work.",
        "Innovative combination of TDA, gradient-based methods, and attention decoding.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan with benchmarking, validation, and ablation studies.",
        "High intellectual depth and originality in proposing a unified geometric framework."

    "Weaknesses": [
        "Feasibility concerns regarding the integration of TDA with gradient-based methods.",
        "Lack of detailed discussion on computational resources and potential scalability issues.",
        "Limited detail on how experiments will control for confounding variables and ensure reproducibility.",
        "Potential over-optimism in the proposed solutions to technical challenges."

        "What are the potential failure modes of the gradient-guided disentanglement approach?",
        "Can you provide more details on the human evaluation protocol and how inter-rater reliability will be ensured?"
