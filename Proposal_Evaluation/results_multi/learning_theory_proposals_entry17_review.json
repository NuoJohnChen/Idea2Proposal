    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a theoretical framework for adaptive synaptic plasticity in dynamic environments, addressing limitations of traditional Hebbian learning. It hypothesizes a meta-plasticity mechanism modulated by environmental feedback and proposes a three-part method involving mathematical modeling, stability analysis, and biological plausibility checks. The experiment plan includes synthetic task validation, neural network simulations, neural data alignment, robustness testing, and theoretical extensions.",
