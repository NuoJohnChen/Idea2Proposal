    "Summary": "The proposal introduces Dynamic Structural Causal Models (DSCMs) to address the limitations of static causal models in AI. It combines dynamic causal discovery with deep learning to infer time-varying or context-dependent causal structures, with applications in healthcare and climate science. The method includes dynamic causal graph inference, identifiability-aware training, and scalable inference via causal attention. The experiment plan covers synthetic benchmarking, robustness testing, and real-world applications.",
