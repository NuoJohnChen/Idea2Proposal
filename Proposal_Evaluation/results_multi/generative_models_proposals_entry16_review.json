    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a framework for generative models with dynamic latent manifolds (DLM) to address mode collapse and limited diversity in current models. It hypothesizes that learning a data-dependent manifold with a learnable metric tensor can improve sample diversity and fidelity. The method includes learnable latent geometry, geodesic adversarial training, and efficient sampling via geodesic flow. Experiments are planned to validate the learned geometry, benchmark against mode collapse, test controllability, assess scalability, and conduct ablation studies.",
