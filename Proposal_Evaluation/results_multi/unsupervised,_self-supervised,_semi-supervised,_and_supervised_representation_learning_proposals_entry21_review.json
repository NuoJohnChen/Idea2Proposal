    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a unified representation learning framework that dynamically combines unsupervised, self-supervised, semi-supervised, and supervised paradigms. It hypothesizes that a shared latent space with adaptive weighting can outperform isolated methods by leveraging their complementary strengths. The method involves a unified latent space design, dynamic paradigm weighting, and efficiency optimization. The experiment plan includes benchmarking isolated paradigms, validating the unified framework, evaluating low-label regimes, scalability testing, and real-world deployment.",
