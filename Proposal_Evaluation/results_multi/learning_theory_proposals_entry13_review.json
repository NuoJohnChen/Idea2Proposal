    "Summary": "The proposal seeks to develop a theoretical framework for understanding implicit structural biases in deep learning optimization, focusing on generalization, optimization dynamics, and architectural choices. It combines theoretical analysis with empirical validation through synthetic and real-world datasets.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Well-articulated problem statement highlighting key challenges in deep learning theory.",
        "Ambitious hypotheses addressing fundamental questions about generalization and optimization.",
        "Comprehensive proposed method combining theoretical and empirical approaches.",
        "Rigorous experimental plan with synthetic and real-world datasets."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Overly ambitious execution plan given the complexity of the problem.",
        "Lacks clear discussion of potential technical challenges and risks.",
        "Experimental plan may not fully validate theoretical claims due to inherent difficulties in modeling deep learning dynamics.",
        "Limited discussion of baselines or alternative approaches to compare against."

    "Questions": [
        "What are the specific technical challenges in developing trajectory-dependent Rademacher complexity?",
        "How will you ensure that the phase transition detection is robust to noise and variability in training dynamics?",
        "What alternative hypotheses or frameworks have you considered, and why is your approach superior?",
        "How will you handle cases where the theoretical predictions do not align with empirical observations?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "Theoretical analysis may not fully capture the complexity of real-world deep learning systems.",
        "Empirical validation may be limited by the difficulty of isolating specific mechanisms in complex models.",
        "Potential over-reliance on synthetic data, which may not generalize to real-world scenarios."
