    "Summary": "The proposal introduces an adaptive trust mechanism for reinforcement learning to dynamically adjust reliance on model-based priors, aiming to improve sample efficiency. It combines uncertainty-aware dynamics modeling, an adaptive trust mechanism, and directed exploration with model uncertainty.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-motivated problem statement.",
        "Novel adaptive trust mechanism for dynamic model reliance.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan covering validation, benchmarking, scalability, and real-world transfer."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks detailed technical specifics on the adaptive trust mechanism implementation.",
        "Uncertainty quantification method is not clearly differentiated from existing approaches.",
        "Experiment plan is generic and lacks specific success metrics.",
        "Theoretical analysis is underdeveloped."
