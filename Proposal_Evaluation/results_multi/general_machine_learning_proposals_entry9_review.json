    "Summary": "The proposal aims to improve machine learning model robustness under distribution shifts by combining causal feature disentanglement, dynamic data augmentation, and test-time adaptation. It targets synthetic benchmarks, domain generalization tasks, and real-world applications like medical imaging and autonomous driving.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-motivated problem statement with strong real-world implications.",
        "Intellectually ambitious hypothesis linking spurious correlations to model brittleness.",
        "Comprehensive experimental plan covering synthetic, benchmark, and real-world datasets.",
        "Integration of multiple promising techniques (causal disentanglement, dynamic augmentation, test-time adaptation)."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lack of detailed technical specifics in the proposed method (e.g., exact loss function formulation).",
        "Unclear computational feasibility of dynamic data augmentation at scale.",
        "Limited discussion of potential failure modes and limitations.",

    "Limitations": [
        "Potential scalability issues with dynamic data augmentation.",
        "Reliance on synthetic benchmarks may not fully capture real-world complexity.",
