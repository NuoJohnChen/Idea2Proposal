    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a novel method for efficient exploration in reinforcement learning using contrastive predictive coding (CPC) to shape intrinsic rewards. It addresses limitations of current exploration methods by distinguishing between stochastic noise and novel states and improving generalization across tasks. The method includes CPC-based exploration, adaptive reward balancing, and task-agnostic pretraining, with a comprehensive experiment plan covering synthetic tasks, high-dimensional control tasks, and scalability studies.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement.",
        "Compelling hypothesis leveraging CPC for improved exploration.",
        "Detailed and structured proposed method with three key components.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan with validation, benchmarking, and scalability studies.",
        "Strong scientific rigor with planned ablation studies and comparisons to baselines."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Feasibility concerns with the adaptive reward balancing scheme.",
        "Potential computational overhead of CPC, which may limit scalability.",
        "Lack of detail on how the CPC model will handle high stochasticity or high-dimensional spaces.",
        "Uncertainty about the robustness of pretrained models to entirely unseen tasks."
