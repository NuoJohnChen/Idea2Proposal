    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a scalable infrastructure for distributed deep learning (DDL) that optimizes communication and computation in heterogeneous clusters. It identifies inefficiencies in current frameworks and proposes a three-part solution: adaptive communication, hardware-aware scheduling, and lightweight profiling. The experiment plan includes benchmarking, validation of adaptive strategies, and ablation studies.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement.",
        "Strong motivation with a compelling hypothesis.",
        "Comprehensive proposed method combining adaptive communication, scheduling, and profiling.",
        "Detailed and rigorous experiment plan, including ablation studies and scalability tests."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks detailed discussion of technical challenges (e.g., overhead of real-time profiling).",
        "Ambitious claims (e.g., 30% reduction in training time) without preliminary results or theoretical analysis.",
        "Limited discussion on handling extreme heterogeneity or failover scenarios."

        "How will the system handle extreme heterogeneity (e.g., nodes with vastly different capabilities)?",
        "Can you provide any preliminary results or theoretical analysis to support the 30% reduction claim?"

    "Limitations": [
        "Potential overhead from real-time profiling and dynamic adaptation.",
        "Complexity of integrating reinforcement learning for straggler prediction.",
        "Scalability under extreme heterogeneity or network failures."
