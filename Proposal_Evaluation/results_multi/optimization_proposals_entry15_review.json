    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a hybrid optimization framework that dynamically switches between zeroth- and first-order methods for non-smooth objectives. It aims to combine the robustness of zeroth-order methods with the efficiency of first-order methods, addressing limitations in current optimization techniques. The method includes a smoothness-aware switching criterion, memory-efficient hybrid updates, and theoretical guarantees. The experiment plan covers synthetic benchmarks, baseline comparisons, high-dimensional problems, theoretical analysis, and real-world deployment.",
