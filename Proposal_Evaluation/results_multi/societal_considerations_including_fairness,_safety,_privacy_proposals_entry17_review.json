    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a unified framework for addressing fairness, safety, and privacy (FSP) trade-offs in AI systems through joint optimization and dynamic trade-offs. It includes a detailed experiment plan with benchmarking, validation, human-in-the-loop calibration, real-world deployment tests, and longitudinal impact assessment.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Addresses a critical and timely issue in AI systems.",
        "Ambitious hypothesis proposing a joint optimization framework.",
        "Comprehensive proposed method combining unified metric design, dynamic trade-off optimization, and system-level auditing.",
        "Detailed and well-structured experiment plan."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks depth in addressing potential technical challenges (e.g., computational complexity).",
        "Feasibility of real-time human-in-the-loop calibration is not thoroughly explored.",
        "Validation plan could benefit from more explicit discussion of baseline comparisons and failure modes.",
