    "Summary": "The proposal aims to extend deep learning to non-Euclidean domains by incorporating geometric and topological priors into neural architectures. It addresses limitations of current GNNs in scalability, geometric priors, and generalization through a three-pronged approach: geometry-aware embeddings, topological signal processing, and adaptive graph attention. The experiment plan includes validation on synthetic and real-world datasets, scalability tests, and downstream applications.",
