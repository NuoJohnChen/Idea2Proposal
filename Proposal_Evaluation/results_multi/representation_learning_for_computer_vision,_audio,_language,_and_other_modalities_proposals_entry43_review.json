    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a unified multimodal representation learning framework combining contrastive and reconstruction-based objectives to bridge vision, audio, and language modalities. It includes modality-specific encoders, a cross-modal fusion module, and scalability to niche modalities. The experiment plan covers validation, transferability, and deployment.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and compelling problem statement addressing limitations of current multimodal models.",
        "Novel hybrid approach combining contrastive and reconstruction-based objectives.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan covering multiple aspects of validation and deployment.",
        "Ambitious goal of scaling to niche modalities with limited paired data."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks detailed technical specifics on encoder design and dynamic attention adjustment.",
        "Scalability to niche modalities is ambitious but lacks concrete support.",
        "Experiment plan could benefit from more detailed ablation studies and stress tests.",
        "Potential computational costs of the proposed fusion module are not addressed."
