    "Summary": "The proposal introduces an adaptive model-based reinforcement learning framework that dynamically weights the reliance on model-based predictions using a meta-learned gating mechanism. It aims to improve sample efficiency and asymptotic performance by addressing the limitations of static model usage in current hybrid RL methods. The method includes uncertainty-aware dynamics priors, a meta-learned gating network, and selective rollouts. The experiment plan covers synthetic tasks, benchmark comparisons, generalization tests, ablation studies, and real-world robotics deployment.",
