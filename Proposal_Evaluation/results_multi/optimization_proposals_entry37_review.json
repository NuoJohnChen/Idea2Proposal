    "Summary": "The proposal introduces HyOpt, a hybrid optimizer combining zeroth- and first-order methods for high-dimensional non-convex problems. It aims to dynamically switch between methods based on problem geometry, leveraging a gradient reliability estimator, zeroth-order adaptation, and dynamic resource allocation. The experiment plan includes validation, benchmarking, scaling, adaptive behavior analysis, and real-world deployment.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement identifying limitations of existing methods.",
        "Innovative core idea combining zeroth- and first-order methods.",
