    "Summary": "The proposal introduces Adaptive Prior RL (APRL), a framework to improve RL efficiency by adaptively weighting model-based priors based on uncertainty. It combines uncertainty-calibrated dynamics models, adaptive prior weighting, and hybrid policy optimization to bridge the gap between model-based and model-free RL. The experiment plan includes validation of uncertainty estimation, benchmarking, long-horizon performance evaluation, ablation studies, and real-world feasibility testing.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and coherent problem statement identifying key limitations of current RL methods.",
        "Compelling hypothesis proposing adaptive weighting of model-based priors based on uncertainty.",
        "Detailed and novel proposed method (APRL) with three technical components.",
        "Thorough experiment plan covering multiple aspects of validation and benchmarking."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks detailed discussion of potential technical challenges and risks.",
        "Could provide clearer justification for the choice of specific baselines and evaluation metrics.",
        "Real-world feasibility testing is ambitious and may require more detailed planning."
