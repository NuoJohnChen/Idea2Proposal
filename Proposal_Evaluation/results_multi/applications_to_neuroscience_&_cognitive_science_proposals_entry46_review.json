    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a biologically plausible spiking neural network (SNN) model to understand cognitive control mechanisms in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), integrating empirical data from neuroimaging and electrophysiology. It hypothesizes a hierarchical, context-sensitive gating mechanism and plans to validate the model against multimodal neural data, with potential clinical applications in schizophrenia and ADHD.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement highlighting the limitations of current computational models.",
        "Intellectually deep hypothesis grounded in existing literature.",
        "Comprehensive proposed method integrating biological plausibility with empirical validation.",
        "Ambitious clinical translation potential."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Feasibility concerns regarding the integration of diverse data types (fMRI, EEG, primate electrophysiology).",
        "Lack of detailed discussion on technical challenges, such as mapping spiking activity to BOLD signals.",
        "Overly optimistic about the ease of clinical validation and scalability of the SNN model.",
        "Execution plan lacks critical analysis of potential pitfalls or alternative approaches."
