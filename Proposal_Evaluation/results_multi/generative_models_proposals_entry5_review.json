    "Summary": "The proposal introduces dynamic latent structures and adaptive computation to enhance diffusion models for long-form content generation. It addresses limitations like quadratic memory overhead and coherence loss through dynamic gating, hierarchical latent scheduling, and efficient attention mechanisms. The experimental plan includes validation on short sequences, audio coherence tests, video benchmarks, and efficiency profiling.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Innovative hypothesis drawing from neuroscience.",
        "Clear problem statement with well-identified limitations.",
        "Comprehensive experimental plan with multiple validation steps.",
        "Potential for significant impact on long-form content generation."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Execution plan is overly optimistic and lacks discussion of technical challenges.",
        "Integration of multiple complex components (dynamic gating, Hyena operators) may be infeasible.",
        "No clear discussion of potential pitfalls or alternative approaches.",
        "Experimental plan may not fully address the scalability of the proposed method."

        "How will the model handle cases where the global structure phase fails to capture long-range dependencies?"

    "Limitations": [
        "Potential high computational cost during training.",
        "Risk of overfitting due to the complexity of the dynamic gating mechanism.",
        "Scalability of the proposed method to extremely long sequences is untested."
