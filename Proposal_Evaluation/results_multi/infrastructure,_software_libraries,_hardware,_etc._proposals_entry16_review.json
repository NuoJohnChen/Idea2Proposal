    "Summary": "The proposal aims to optimize distributed deep learning (DDL) in heterogeneous clusters by introducing dynamic task scheduling, adaptive communication compression, and memory-efficient checkpointing. It targets inefficiencies in existing frameworks like PyTorch Distributed and Horovod, with a focus on improving resource utilization and reducing communication overhead. The experiment plan includes benchmarking, validation, testing, and ablation studies.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement.",
        "Strong motivation with a compelling hypothesis.",
        "Detailed proposed method with three distinct components.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan including benchmarking, validation, testing, and ablation studies."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Feasibility concerns with dynamic task scheduling and adaptive communication compression.",
        "Lack of detailed discussion on potential technical challenges and trade-offs.",
        "Scalability claims to very large clusters (e.g., 512 GPUs) are not thoroughly justified.",
        "Engineering effort required for implementation may be underestimated."

    "Limitations": [
        "Potential overhead from dynamic scheduling may offset some of the performance gains.",
