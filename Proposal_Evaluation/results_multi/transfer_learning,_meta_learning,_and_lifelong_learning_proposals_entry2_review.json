    "Summary": "The proposal aims to unify transfer, meta, and lifelong learning into a single framework using a hierarchical memory architecture. It addresses gaps in current systems by proposing task-agnostic feature embeddings, dynamic meta-parameters, and sparse experience replay. The experiment plan includes benchmarking against isolated baselines, cross-domain generalization, lifelong learning stress tests, meta-learning novel tasks, and real-world deployment.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement.",
        "High intellectual ambition with a compelling hypothesis.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan covering multiple aspects of the proposed framework.",
        "Strong motivation backed by recent literature."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks detailed technical specifics on integrating the three components.",
        "Real-world deployment seems overly optimistic and may not be feasible.",
        "Insufficient discussion on potential failure modes and biases in experiments.",
        "Limited justification for the 30% reduction in forgetting claim."

        "How will the method scale to extremely large task sequences?",
        "What specific metrics will be used to evaluate the synergy between the three paradigms?"
