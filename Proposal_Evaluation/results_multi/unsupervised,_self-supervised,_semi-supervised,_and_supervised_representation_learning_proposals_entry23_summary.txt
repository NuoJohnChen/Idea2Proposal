Weaknesses: Lacks depth in explaining how the dynamic gating mechanism theoretically unifies paradigms., Technical implementation of the gating mechanism remains speculative without concrete solutions to gradient interference., Experimental plan lacks critical stress tests (e.g., extreme label noise, adversarial robustness).
