    "Summary": "The proposal aims to bridge the gap between correlation and causation in neural networks by introducing a framework for latent causal graph learning, intervention-aware representation learning, and invariant prediction. It targets scalable, unsupervised causal reasoning and plans extensive validation on synthetic and real-world datasets.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Addresses a critical and timely problem in AI.",
        "Compelling hypothesis with a dual optimization approach.",
        "Ambitious and novel combination of methods (latent causal graph learning, intervention-aware representation, invariant prediction).",
        "Comprehensive experimental validation plan."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Feasibility concerns in high-dimensional settings.",
        "Lacks detailed discussion on potential failure modes.",
        "Execution plan could be more grounded in addressing technical challenges.",
        "Validation strategies, while comprehensive, may lack depth in critical analyses."

    "Questions": [
        "How will the model handle cases where the latent DAG is misspecified?",
        "What are the computational costs of the proposed GNN-based DAG learning in high-dimensional settings?",
        "How will the intervention mechanism perform with limited or noisy interventional data?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "Scalability to very high-dimensional data is uncertain.",
        "Potential over-reliance on synthetic data for validation.",
        "May struggle with unobserved confounders in real-world datasets."
