    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a hybrid framework combining flow-enhanced variational inference and SG-MCMC to improve scalability and accuracy of probabilistic methods in deep learning. It targets limitations in current Bayesian methods, such as computational inefficiency and poor posterior approximation, and proposes a three-part methodology with validation on synthetic and real-world datasets.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement highlighting key limitations of current probabilistic methods.",
        "Technically sound methodology building on established work in VI and SG-MCMC.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan covering synthetic benchmarks, Bayesian neural networks, and large-scale datasets."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks significant novelty; the hybrid approach is a straightforward combination of existing techniques.",
        "Limited discussion of potential challenges (e.g., convergence, computational overhead).",
        "No clear evidence of how the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives."

    "Questions": [
        "How does the proposed hybrid method theoretically guarantee better convergence or approximation than standalone VI or SG-MCMC?",
        "What are the computational trade-offs between flow depth and MCMC steps in practice?",
        "How will the method handle extremely high-dimensional spaces (e.g., modern transformer architectures)?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "Potential computational overhead from combining flow architectures with SG-MCMC.",
        "Unclear scalability to very high-dimensional models (e.g., LLMs).",
        "Risk of residual approximation biases despite hybrid refinement."
