    "Summary": "The proposal aims to unify transfer learning, meta-learning, and lifelong learning through dynamic representation composition, combining meta-learned initialization, task-conditioned feature modulation, and memory-augmented replay. The method extends MAML with modulation layers, integrates EWC for forgetting constraints, and uses a memory bank for lifelong adaptation. The experiment plan includes benchmarking, lifelong performance evaluation, ablation studies, scalability tests, and theoretical analysis.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement identifying gaps in existing paradigms.",
        "Ambitious hypothesis proposing a hybrid architecture.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan covering benchmarking, lifelong performance, ablation studies, scalability, and theoretical analysis.",
        "Technically sound method leveraging established techniques like MAML, EWC, and memory networks."
