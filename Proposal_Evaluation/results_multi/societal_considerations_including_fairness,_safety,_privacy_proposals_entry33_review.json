    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a unified framework for jointly optimizing fairness, safety, and privacy in AI systems, addressing interdependencies and trade-offs among these dimensions. It includes unified metrics, adaptive constraint optimization, and deployment-time monitoring, validated through a detailed experiment plan involving benchmarking, real-world deployment, and human-in-the-loop evaluation.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and compelling problem statement highlighting the limitations of current siloed approaches.",
        "Strong motivation backed by relevant prior work demonstrating interdependencies and trade-offs.",
        "Ambitious proposed method combining unified metrics, adaptive constraint optimization, and deployment-time monitoring.",
        "Detailed and multi-faceted experiment plan enhancing rigor and potential impact."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks detailed discussion of computational and practical challenges, especially scalability.",
        "Feasibility of real-world deployment, particularly in high-stakes domains, is uncertain.",
        "Vague description of human-in-the-loop evaluation and risk mitigation strategies."
