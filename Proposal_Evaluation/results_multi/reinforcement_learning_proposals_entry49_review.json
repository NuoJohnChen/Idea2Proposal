    "Summary": "The proposal aims to improve sample efficiency in reinforcement learning by developing a framework that dynamically balances model-free and model-based RL using adaptive uncertainty quantification. The method involves uncertainty-aware dynamics modeling, adaptive policy optimization, and efficient exploration with model priors. The experiment plan includes validation of uncertainty estimation, benchmarking against baselines, generalization tests, ablation studies, and real-world validation.",
