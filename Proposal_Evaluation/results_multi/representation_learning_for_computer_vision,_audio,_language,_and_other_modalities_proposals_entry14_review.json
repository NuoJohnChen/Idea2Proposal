    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a unified multimodal representation learning framework that bridges vision, audio, and language modalities through a shared latent space with modality-specific adapters and hierarchical cross-modal attention. It addresses current limitations in multimodal learning by proposing a scalable, generalizable approach.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and compelling problem statement addressing a timely and important challenge in AI.",
        "Novel proposal of a hierarchical cross-modal attention mechanism and shared latent space.",
        "Comprehensive experimental plan covering validation, transfer performance, and scalability.",
        "Strong argumentative cohesion with a logical progression from problem to solution."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lack of detailed technical solutions for potential challenges (e.g., modality alignment, computational complexity).",
        "Ambition may exceed feasibility given the current state of multimodal research.",
        "Limited discussion of failure modes or edge cases in the experimental plan.",
        "Modality dropout, while promising, lacks empirical validation in this context."

        "How will the hierarchical attention mechanism be optimized to avoid excessive computational overhead?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "Potential computational bottlenecks due to the complexity of multimodal training.",
        "Risk of overfitting to dominant modalities (e.g., language) in the shared latent space.",
        "Generalization to novel modalities (e.g., tactile, thermal) may require significant architectural adjustments."
