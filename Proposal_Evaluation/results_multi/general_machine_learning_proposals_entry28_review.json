    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a framework to bridge the generalization gap in machine learning by combining dynamic architecture design, uncertainty-aware training, and modular components. It aims to improve robustness, adaptability, and interpretability through advanced techniques like gated sparse transformers, neural ODEs, and evidential deep learning. The experiment plan includes synthetic benchmarking, distribution shift evaluation, real-world deployment, ablation studies, and scalability analysis.",
