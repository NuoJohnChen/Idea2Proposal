    "Summary": "The proposal seeks to unify metric learning, kernel learning, and sparse coding into a single framework for robust representation learning. It hypothesizes that combining these methods can address their individual limitations and improve performance. The proposed method includes kernelized metric learning with sparsity, adaptive kernel learning, and a unified optimization framework. The experiment plan covers synthetic data validation, benchmarking, large-scale testing, ablation studies, and theoretical analysis.",
    "Strengths": [
