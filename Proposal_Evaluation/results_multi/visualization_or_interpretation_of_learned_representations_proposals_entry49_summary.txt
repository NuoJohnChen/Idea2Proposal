Weaknesses: Lacks detailed technical specifics on implementation, particularly for causal disentanglement., Execution credibility is uncertain due to under-specified methods., Proposed causal disentanglement component seems ambitious and may face significant technical challenges., Scalability of hierarchical attribution graphs to very deep networks is not thoroughly addressed., Validation plan could benefit from more concrete details on validation against baselines.
