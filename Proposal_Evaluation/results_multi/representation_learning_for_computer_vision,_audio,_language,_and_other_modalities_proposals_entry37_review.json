    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a unified representation learning framework for vision, audio, and language modalities, leveraging cross-modal self-supervision and dynamic feature alignment. It aims to overcome the limitations of modality-specific methods by learning a shared latent space from unpaired or weakly aligned data. The experiment plan includes validation, benchmarking, and ablation studies to evaluate the framework's performance and efficiency.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement.",
        "Ambitious hypothesis with potential for broad impact.",
        "Innovative proposed method, including modality-agnostic objectives and dynamic feature fusion.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan with validation, benchmarking, and ablation studies."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Feasibility of achieving state-of-the-art performance across all modalities with unpaired data is uncertain.",
        "Lacks detailed discussion on potential technical challenges (e.g., modality imbalance, feature misalignment).",
        "Execution plan could benefit from more concrete risk mitigation strategies."

    "Questions": [
        "How will the proposed method handle significant modality imbalances (e.g., more text data than audio)?",
        "What are the specific computational requirements for training the unified model, and how will scalability be ensured?",
        "How will the dynamic feature fusion mechanism adapt to missing modalities at test time?",
        "What are the fallback strategies if dynamic feature fusion fails to generalize across modalities?",
        "How will the model ensure semantic consistency when modalities are weakly aligned or unpaired?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "Potential difficulty in aligning features across modalities with unpaired data.",
        "Risk of overfitting to dominant modalities (e.g., text) due to data imbalance.",
        "Computational overhead of training a unified model may be prohibitive.",
        "Generalization to real-world scenarios with noisy or incomplete multimodal data is uncertain."
