    "Summary": "The proposal aims to integrate causal reasoning into neural networks by developing a variational framework for learning latent causal structures and incorporating intervention-aware training. The goal is to improve out-of-distribution generalization and counterfactual reasoning, leveraging recent advances in causal inference and neural networks.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Addresses a significant and timely problem in AI.",
        "Well-articulated problem statement and motivation grounded in recent literature.",
        "Ambitious and intellectually deep hypothesis.",
        "Comprehensive experimental plan with synthetic and real-world benchmarks."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Technical details on the variational framework and contrastive loss are sparse, making it hard to assess feasibility.",
        "Scalability to high-dimensional data is claimed but not substantiated with concrete strategies.",
        "Baseline comparisons in the experimental plan lack specificity (e.g., versions of PC algorithm or neural causal models)."

    "Questions": [
        "How will sparsity and modularity constraints be enforced in the variational framework?",
        "What are the exact formulations of the contrastive loss and masked forward passes?",
        "How will partial causal knowledge in MIMIC-III be operationalized for training?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "Inference of latent causal structures is inherently uncertain, especially without ground-truth graphs.",
        "Intervention simulation may not cover real-world complexity.",
        "Computational costs of hybrid architecture could limit practical adoption."
