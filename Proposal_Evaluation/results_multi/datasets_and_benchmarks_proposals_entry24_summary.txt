Overall Quality: 7
Argumentative Cohesion: 8
Intellectual Depth: 7
Execution Credibility: 6
Scientific Rigor: 7
Decision: Accept
Weaknesses: Execution plan lacks detailed technical solutions for potential challenges (e.g., dynamic evaluation protocols)., Limited discussion on computational costs of large-scale validation., Validation plan could benefit from more detailed ablation studies.
