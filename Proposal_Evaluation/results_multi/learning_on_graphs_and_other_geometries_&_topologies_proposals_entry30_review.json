    "Summary": "The proposal aims to extend deep learning to non-Euclidean domains by unifying geometric priors with adaptive computation. It addresses limitations in current GNNs, such as limited expressive power, scalability, and generalization across geometries. The proposed method includes unified geometric encoders, adaptive message passing, and scalable training techniques. The experiment plan is comprehensive, covering validation, benchmarking, scalability, and generalization.",
