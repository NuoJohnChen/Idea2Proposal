    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a unified framework for scalable and robust probabilistic inference in deep learning by combining SG-MCMC, flexible variational inference, and Bayesian deep learning. It addresses limitations in scalability, approximation bias, and uncertainty calibration with a comprehensive experiment plan.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement with well-articulated limitations of existing methods.",
        "Ambitious goal of integrating Bayesian methods with deep learning.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan covering synthetic and real-world applications."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Integration of existing techniques lacks groundbreaking novelty.",
        "Experiment plan is ambitious but may face scalability challenges.",
        "Technical details on integration trade-offs could be deeper."

        "What specific technical challenges will arise in integrating these methods into transformers, and how will they be addressed?",
        "How will the proposed methods compare to recent advances in scalable Bayesian deep learning (e.g., SWAG, Deep Ensembles)?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "Potential computational inefficiency due to hybrid methods.",
        "Risk of overfitting or instability in high-dimensional spaces.",
        "Uncertainty calibration may still be challenging in practice."
