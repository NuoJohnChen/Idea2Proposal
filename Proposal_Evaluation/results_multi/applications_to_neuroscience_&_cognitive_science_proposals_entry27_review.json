    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a biologically plausible computational model of dynamic attention, integrating hierarchical gating mechanisms, spiking neural networks, and cross-level validation with empirical neural data. It seeks to address the gap between static computational models and dynamic human attention observed in cognitive neuroscience.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement.",
        "Ambitious and intellectually deep hypothesis grounded in recent neuroscientific findings.",
        "Comprehensive proposed method combining biologically inspired neural networks and spiking neural networks.",
        "Detailed and rigorous experimental plan with cross-level validation and benchmarking."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Feasibility concerns, particularly with the integration of spiking neural networks and alignment with empirical neural data.",
        "Potential technical challenges in achieving millisecond-scale temporal precision.",
        "Lack of detailed discussion on potential pitfalls and alternative approaches if the proposed method fails."

        "What specific datasets from the Human Connectome Project will be used, and how will they be preprocessed?",
        "What are the fallback plans if the model fails to align with empirical neural data?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "The integration of spiking neural networks may introduce significant computational overhead.",
        "The alignment with empirical neural data may be challenging due to variability in human subjects.",
        "The model's performance may be limited by the quality and granularity of available neural datasets."
