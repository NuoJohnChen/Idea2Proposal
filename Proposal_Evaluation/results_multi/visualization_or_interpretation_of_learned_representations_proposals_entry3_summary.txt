Weaknesses: Feasibility concerns with L0 regularization and Riemannian metric analysis, which could be computationally intensive., Human evaluation component (50 participants) may lack statistical robustness., Lack of discussion on potential biases in concept definitions (e.g., Broden dataset) and their impact on interpretability., Limited risk assessment and mitigation strategies for potential technical challenges.
