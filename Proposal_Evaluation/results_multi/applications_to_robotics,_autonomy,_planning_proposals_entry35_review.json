    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a hybrid neuro-symbolic framework for dynamic hierarchical planning in autonomous robots, combining learned predictive models with symbolic reasoning to balance reactivity and deliberative reasoning. It leverages Bayesian neural networks, graph neural networks, and reinforcement learning to dynamically adjust planning hierarchies based on environmental uncertainty. The experiment plan includes simulation, generalization tests, hardware deployment, ablation studies, and scalability analysis.",
