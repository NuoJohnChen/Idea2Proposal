Overall Quality: 7
Argumentative Cohesion: 8
Intellectual Depth: 7
Execution Credibility: 6
Scientific Rigor: 7
Decision: Accept
Weaknesses: Execution plan lacks depth in addressing technical challenges (e.g., RL-based scheduler complexity)., Overhead of dynamic switching between communication modes is not thoroughly discussed., Experimental plan could benefit from more critical analyses (e.g., failure modes of hybrid protocol)., Potential underestimation of implementation hurdles.
