    "Summary": "The proposal aims to bridge the gap between correlation and causation in neural networks by developing a unified framework for joint causal structure discovery and inference. It combines differentiable causal discovery, causal latent mechanisms, and end-to-end joint training, with experiments planned on synthetic benchmarks, causal RL, high-dimensional data, and language-based tasks.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement.",
        "Strong motivation and hypothesis.",
        "Ambitious and innovative proposed method.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan covering multiple domains."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Feasibility concerns with high-dimensional data and scalability of joint training.",
        "Lack of detailed discussion on potential pitfalls and alternative approaches.",
        "Limited discussion on how to handle dynamic or uncertain causal graphs in practice."
