    "Summary": "The proposal introduces AGMO, a dynamic meta-optimization framework designed to address non-stationary objectives in optimization tasks. It combines dynamic gradient modeling, stability guarantees, and efficient implementation to improve convergence and generalization in dynamic environments. The experimental plan covers synthetic benchmarks, reinforcement learning, meta-learning, and adversarial robustness.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement highlighting limitations of existing optimizers.",
        "Compelling hypothesis suggesting a novel approach to non-stationary optimization.",
        "Comprehensive experimental plan covering multiple domains and theoretical analysis.",
        "Strong argumentative cohesion with a logical narrative connecting problem, hypothesis, and solution."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks detailed discussion on potential technical challenges and risks.",
        "Computational overhead of the meta-network is not thoroughly addressed.",
        "Feasibility of enforcing Lyapunov-style stability conditions is unclear.",
        "Intellectual depth may be limited as the core idea builds on existing work.",
        "Experimental plan could benefit from more rigorous baselines and ablation studies."

        "Can you provide more detail on the baselines and ablation studies planned to validate the claims?",
        "How does AGMO fundamentally differ from existing meta-optimizers like L4 or learned optimizers?"

    "Limitations": [
        "Potential high computational overhead from the meta-network.",
        "Uncertainty in enforcing stability conditions in dynamic environments.",
