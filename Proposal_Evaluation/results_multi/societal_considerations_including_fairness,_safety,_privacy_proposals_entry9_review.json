    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a joint optimization framework to integrate fairness, safety, and privacy in AI systems, addressing the siloed nature of current approaches. It includes unified metric design, adaptive optimization, and system-level auditing, with a comprehensive experiment plan covering synthetic benchmarking, domain-specific validation, trade-off analysis, real-world deployment, and regulatory alignment testing.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Timely and critical problem statement addressing a significant gap in AI systems.",
        "Clear and compelling hypothesis about the interdependence of fairness, safety, and privacy.",
        "Ambitious and comprehensive proposed method with strong alignment to regulatory frameworks.",
        "Detailed and thorough experiment plan covering multiple validation scenarios."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Feasibility concerns, particularly around the computational complexity of joint optimization and real-world deployment.",
        "Lack of detailed discussion on potential technical challenges and risks.",
        "Overly optimistic assumptions about the practicality of regulatory alignment testing.",
        "Limited discussion on limitations and potential failure modes of the proposed framework."
