    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a hybrid framework combining adaptive SG-MCMC, implicit variational inference, and uncertainty-aware deep learning to address scalability, approximation bias, and uncertainty calibration in probabilistic methods for deep learning. It proposes a comprehensive experimental plan with synthetic and real-world datasets.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement.",
        "Ambitious and theoretically sound proposed method.",
        "Comprehensive experimental plan with diverse benchmarks and metrics."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks detailed technical solutions for potential challenges (e.g., computational overhead of adaptive SG-MCMC).",
        "Execution plan could be more grounded with specific risk management strategies.",
        "Integration complexity of uncertainty-aware layers is not thoroughly addressed."
