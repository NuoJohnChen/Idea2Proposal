    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a hybrid architecture combining Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) and hierarchical attention mechanisms to improve the efficiency and accuracy of multiscale simulations in physics and materials science. It addresses the limitations of existing methods, such as lack of generalization and high computational cost, and proposes a comprehensive experiment plan covering canonical PDEs, multiscale materials modeling, high-resolution validation, ablation studies, and real-world deployment.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement.",
        "Innovative combination of FNOs and hierarchical attention mechanisms.",
