Weaknesses: Feasibility of integrating all components into a unified framework is questionable., Lacks depth in addressing potential technical challenges, such as computational overhead and scalability., Real-world deployment study might be overly optimistic given the complexity of the proposed framework., Limited discussion on how to balance trade-offs between fairness, privacy, and safety in practice.
