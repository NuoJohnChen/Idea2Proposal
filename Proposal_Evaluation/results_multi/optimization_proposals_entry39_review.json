    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a hybrid optimization framework combining zeroth-order and first-order methods for non-smooth and high-dimensional problems. It dynamically switches between update types using a learned gating mechanism, with applications in adversarial training, reinforcement learning, and black-box optimization.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement highlighting limitations of existing methods.",
        "Innovative approach with a dynamic gating mechanism for adaptive update selection.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan covering validation, benchmarking, and real-world deployment.",
        "Potential for significant impact in non-smooth and high-dimensional optimization tasks."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Feasibility concerns about the dynamic gating mechanism, especially computational overhead.",
        "Lack of detailed discussion on scalability and distributed implementation.",
        "Theoretical guarantees are mentioned but not thoroughly developed.",
        "Validation plan could benefit from more critical analyses like failure mode exploration."

    "Questions": [
        "How will the gating mechanism be trained online without introducing significant computational overhead?",
        "What are the specific assumptions under which the theoretical guarantees will be derived?",
        "How will the method handle cases where both gradient and zeroth-order updates are unreliable?",
        "What are the fallback strategies if the gating mechanism fails to predict reliability accurately?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "Potential high computational cost due to the gating mechanism.",
        "Scalability challenges in distributed settings may limit real-world applicability.",
        "Reliance on theoretical assumptions (e.g., Lipschitz continuity) may not hold in all practical scenarios."
