    "Summary": "The proposal aims to improve machine learning robustness to distribution shifts by combining invariant feature learning, dynamic test-time adaptation, and causal regularization. It targets spurious correlations as a key limitation and proposes a framework to enhance out-of-distribution generalization. The experimental plan includes synthetic benchmarking, domain generalization tasks, real-world deployment, scalability testing, and human-in-the-loop evaluation.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-motivated problem statement.",
        "Novel integration of causal inference and self-supervised learning.",
        "Comprehensive experimental plan covering synthetic and real-world scenarios.",
        "Strong relevance to current challenges in machine learning."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks detailed discussion on scalability of test-time adaptation.",
        "Unclear feasibility of integrating causal graphs in high-dimensional settings.",
        "Limited discussion on potential failure modes and robustness checks.",
        "Baseline comparisons could be more detailed."
