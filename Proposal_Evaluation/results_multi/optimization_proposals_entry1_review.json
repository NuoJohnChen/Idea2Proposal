    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a meta-adaptive mechanism for gradient-based optimization methods to handle non-stationary objectives in deep learning. It combines gradient coherence statistics and an online Bayesian bandit model to dynamically adjust optimizer hyperparameters. The method is evaluated through synthetic benchmarks, adversarial robustness tests, and large-scale language modeling.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Addresses an important and timely problem in deep learning optimization.",
        "Novel combination of gradient coherence metrics and online Bayesian bandit models.",
        "Comprehensive experimental plan covering synthetic, adversarial, and large-scale scenarios.",
        "Potential for significant impact on optimization methods if successful."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Feasibility concerns regarding the computational overhead of the Bayesian bandit model.",
        "Lack of detail on how non-stationarity detection will be validated in practice.",
        "Scalability to very large models (e.g., 10B parameters) is not convincingly demonstrated.",
        "Potential risk of overfitting the method to specific non-stationary scenarios."

        "How will the method handle cases where non-stationarity is not detectable via gradient coherence?",
        "What are the fallback mechanisms if the meta-adaptation fails to converge?"

    "Limitations": [
        "The method may not generalize to all types of non-stationarity.",
        "Computational overhead could limit practical applicability to very large models.",
        "Dependence on gradient coherence may introduce bias in certain scenarios."
