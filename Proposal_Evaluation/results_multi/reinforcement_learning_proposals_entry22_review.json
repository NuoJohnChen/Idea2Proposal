    "Summary": "The proposal introduces CPC-Explore, a method for efficient exploration in RL using Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC) to shape intrinsic rewards. It aims to address limitations of current exploration methods by leveraging CPC's ability to capture task-relevant novelty. The framework includes CPC-Explore, dynamic reward balancing, and theoretical analysis, with a comprehensive experiment plan covering benchmarking, ablation studies, generalization, theoretical validation, and real-world deployment.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement.",
        "Novel integration of CPC into RL for intrinsic reward shaping.",
        "Comprehensive experimental plan with benchmarks, ablations, and real-world deployment.",
        "Theoretical analysis component adds rigor to the proposal."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lack of detailed discussion on potential technical challenges (e.g., training stability, scalability).",
        "Feasibility of theoretical analysis is uncertain without more concrete details.",
        "Computational overhead of transformer-based architecture is not adequately addressed.",
        "Limited emphasis on failure modes and edge cases in the experimental plan."
