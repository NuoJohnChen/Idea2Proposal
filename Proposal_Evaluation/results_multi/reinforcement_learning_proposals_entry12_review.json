    "Summary": "The proposal introduces adaptive model-based priors (AMPs) to improve the sample efficiency of reinforcement learning (RL) by combining hierarchical Bayesian dynamics models, uncertainty-aware policy optimization, and meta-learning priors across tasks. The experiment plan includes validation on synthetic benchmarks, continuous control tasks, cross-task generalization, high-dimensional observations, and a real-world feasibility study.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement highlighting the sample inefficiency of current RL methods.",
        "Compelling hypothesis suggesting adaptive priors can address rigidity in MBRL.",
        "Ambitious proposed method combining hierarchical Bayesian models, uncertainty-aware policy optimization, and meta-learning.",
        "Detailed experiment plan covering a range of scenarios from synthetic to real-world tasks."

    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks technical depth in explaining the implementation of hierarchical Bayesian dynamics models.",
        "Uncertainty-aware policy optimization derivation is not thoroughly discussed.",
        "Scalability to high-dimensional observations is not thoroughly addressed.",
        "Real-world feasibility study is somewhat vague."
