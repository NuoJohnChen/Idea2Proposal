Weaknesses: Lacks detailed discussion of technical challenges in designing a truly modality-agnostic backbone., Potential risks of adapter overfitting or routing mechanism instability are not thoroughly addressed., Limited discussion of how the dynamic routing mechanism will be trained or its scalability to many modalities., No mention of potential negative societal impacts or ethical considerations of unified multimodal models.
