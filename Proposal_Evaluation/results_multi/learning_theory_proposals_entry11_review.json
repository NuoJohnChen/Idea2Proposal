    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a unified theoretical and empirical framework for sample-efficient generalization in deep learning, combining trajectory-dependent optimization bias and data-dependent structural properties. It includes three main components: trajectory-dependent generalization bounds, geometry-aware architecture design, and sample efficiency via implicit regularization. The experiment plan covers validation of bounds, architecture ablations, low-data regime benchmarking, sharpness vs. generalization, and real-world deployment.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Well-articulated problem statement highlighting the disconnect between classical learning theory and modern deep learning practices.",
        "Ambitious hypothesis combining trajectory-dependent optimization bias and data-dependent structural properties.",
        "Detailed proposed method with three distinct components.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan covering multiple aspects of the framework."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Feasibility concerns about the proposed theoretical derivations, especially dynamic Rademacher complexity and extending NTK to finite-width networks.",
        "Lack of detailed discussion on potential technical challenges and mitigation strategies.",
        "Overly ambitious experimental plan given theoretical uncertainties.",
        "Limited concrete examples of practical application and validation beyond standard benchmarks."

        "How will the proposed framework be validated beyond standard benchmarks to ensure its practical applicability?",
        "What are the potential failure modes of the proposed complexity metric, and how will they be mitigated?"

    "Limitations": [
        "Theoretical derivations may be overly ambitious and difficult to achieve.",
        "Experimental plan may be too broad, risking dilution of focus.",
        "Potential lack of generalizability of the framework beyond specific architectures and datasets."
