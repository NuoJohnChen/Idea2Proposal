Weaknesses: Feasibility of integrating complex neural dynamics into a single model is highly challenging and not thoroughly discussed., Lack of discussion on potential technical hurdles, such as computational complexity of SNNs or interpretability of simulated fMRI signals., Experimental plan may be overly optimistic given the scope and complexity of the proposed work., Limited critical discussion on limitations and alternative approaches.
