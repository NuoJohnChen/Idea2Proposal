    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a unified framework for visualizing and disentangling learned features in deep neural networks (DNNs) by integrating activation patching, concept activation vectors, and information bottleneck regularization. The goal is to produce human-interpretable and robust representations.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-structured proposal with a logical flow from problem statement to solution.",
        "Addresses a critical and timely problem in deep learning.",
        "Proposes a novel integration of existing techniques to achieve interpretability.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan with multiple validation steps."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Feasibility of combining multiple advanced techniques is uncertain.",
        "Novelty of the approach is somewhat limited, as it builds heavily on existing work.",
        "Experimental plan could benefit from more detailed ablation studies and stress tests.",
        "Potential technical challenges in scaling the method to language models are not fully addressed."

        "What are the computational costs of integrating activation patching, concept activation vectors, and information bottleneck regularization?",
        "How will the method ensure that the visualized features are not just artifacts of the visualization process?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "The method may not generalize well to all types of neural architectures.",
        "The quality of interpretability may depend heavily on the quality of the concept probes.",
        "The proposed method may introduce additional hyperparameters that need careful tuning."
