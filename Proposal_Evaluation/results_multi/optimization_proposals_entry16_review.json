    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a hybrid optimizer combining zeroth- and first-order methods for non-smooth objectives, leveraging a smoothness-aware gating mechanism. It aims to address limitations of gradient-based methods in noisy or non-smooth settings, with validation planned across synthetic tasks, ML benchmarks, and theoretical analysis.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement highlighting limitations of existing methods.",
        "Innovative hypothesis proposing dynamic switching between zeroth- and first-order methods.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan covering synthetic, ML, and theoretical validation.",
        "Strong ambition and novelty in addressing non-smooth optimization."
