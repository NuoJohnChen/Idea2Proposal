Weaknesses: Reinforcement learning-based policy optimization may introduce unpredictable overheads and convergence issues., Scalability claims for 1000+ node clusters lack empirical justification or simulation-based validation., Hardware-aware scheduling assumes ideal profiling accuracy, which may not hold in real-world heterogeneous environments.
