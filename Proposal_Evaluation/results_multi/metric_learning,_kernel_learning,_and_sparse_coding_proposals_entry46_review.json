    "Summary": "The proposal aims to unify metric learning, kernel learning, and sparse coding into a single framework for robust representation learning. It identifies the limitations of each method when used in isolation and hypothesizes that their integration can overcome these limitations. The proposed method includes kernel-metric co-learning, sparse coding in kernel space, and efficient optimization. The experiment plan covers synthetic validation, benchmark comparisons, interpretability analysis, scalability testing, and downstream task transfer.",
