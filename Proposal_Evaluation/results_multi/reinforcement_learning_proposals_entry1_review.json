    "Summary": "The proposal introduces an adaptive model-based RL framework to improve sample efficiency by dynamically balancing model-free and model-based updates based on uncertainty and learning progress. It includes uncertainty-calibrated model learning, dynamic policy-update weighting, and stabilized long-horizon rollouts. The experiment plan covers validation, ablation studies, and real-world deployment.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-motivated problem statement grounded in prior work.",
        "Innovative hypothesis with a novel dynamic weighting mechanism.",
        "Technically sound proposed method leveraging ensemble models and uncertainty estimation.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan including validation, ablation studies, and real-world deployment."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks detailed discussion on computational overhead of ensemble models.",
        "Scalability of dynamic weighting mechanism to high-dimensional spaces is not thoroughly explored.",
        "Potential risks in real-world deployment (e.g., sim-to-real gaps) are not deeply analyzed."

        "How will the method handle non-stationary environments where the dynamics model may drift?",
        "What specific regularization techniques will be used to prevent overfitting in the ensemble models?"

    "Limitations": [
        "Computational cost of ensemble models may limit scalability.",
        "Dynamic weighting mechanism may introduce additional hyperparameters that require tuning.",
        "Real-world deployment may face challenges due to sim-to-real gaps."
