    "Summary": "The proposal introduces Dynamic Structural Causal Models (DSCMs) to address the limitations of static causal models in AI. It aims to develop scalable, flexible, and adaptive causal models using neural networks, Gumbel-Softmax, and causal attention. The experiment plan includes validation on synthetic and real-world datasets, with a focus on healthcare, genomics, and climate modeling.",
    "Strengths": [
