    "Summary": "The proposal aims to bridge the gap between empirical success and theoretical understanding in deep learning by investigating the roles of implicit regularization, data geometry, and optimization dynamics in generalization. It proposes a three-pronged approach combining theoretical analysis, geometric investigation, and empirical validation.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Addresses a significant and timely problem in deep learning.",
        "Well-motivated hypothesis aligned with recent literature.",
        "Comprehensive and logically structured three-pronged approach.",
        "Detailed empirical validation plan with controlled experiments."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Theoretical component is ambitious and may face significant execution challenges.",
        "Lacks detailed discussion on potential pitfalls in empirical validation (e.g., scalability to large models).",
        "Limited specificity in extending the theoretical framework (e.g., PAC-Bayes)."

    "Questions": [
        "How will the proposed theoretical framework differ from existing work on implicit regularization?",
        "What are the specific challenges in deriving non-vacuous bounds, and how will you address them?",
        "How scalable are the proposed methods to large-scale models like ViTs and LLMs?",
        "What specific tools will be developed to measure 'effective complexity' of neural networks?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "Theoretical derivations may not yield non-vacuous bounds as hoped.",
        "Empirical validation may not generalize to all types of data distributions.",
        "Scalability to very large models is uncertain."
