    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a Multiscale Neural Operator (MNO) framework to address computational inefficiencies in simulating multiscale physical systems. It combines hierarchical feature extraction, dynamic resolution adaptation, and physics-constrained training to improve accuracy and efficiency. The experiment plan includes validation on synthetic PDEs, canonical problems, generalization tests, and real-world applications.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement.",
        "Innovative hypothesis integrating adaptive resolution capabilities into neural operators.",
        "Detailed and comprehensive experiment plan covering a range of validation steps.",
        "Potential for significant impact in computational physics and machine learning."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Insufficient analysis of computational trade-offs (e.g., memory vs. accuracy) in dynamic resolution adaptation.",
        "Scalability to high-dimensional systems (e.g., molecular dynamics) lacks concrete benchmarks or feasibility guarantees.",
        "Integration of reinforcement learning-inspired objectives may introduce training instability or convergence issues."
