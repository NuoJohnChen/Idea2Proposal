    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a robust multi-agent planning system under uncertainty by integrating learned latent dynamics models with hierarchical task decomposition. It addresses the limitations of existing model-based and learning-based methods, proposing a hybrid approach that combines uncertainty-calibrated latent dynamics, hierarchical planning, and distributed optimization. The experiment plan includes validation of latent dynamics, benchmarking against baselines, multi-agent coordination, hardware deployment, and ablation studies.",
