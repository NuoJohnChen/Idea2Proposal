    "Summary": "The proposal aims to improve distributed deep learning infrastructure by optimizing communication and hardware utilization through a hybrid communication protocol and an adaptive runtime scheduler. It targets scalability and efficiency in large-scale model training, integrating gradient compression, topology-aware collective operations, and reinforcement learning-based scheduling.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement with well-defined bottlenecks in current DDL frameworks.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan with benchmarking, scheduler evaluation, and ablation studies.",
        "Strong motivation backed by prior work, with a focus on practical implementation.",
        "Integration with existing frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow) enhances practicality."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Intellectual depth is limited; core ideas (gradient compression, RL scheduling) are not novel.",
        "Execution plan lacks detailed discussion of technical challenges (e.g., RL training stability, protocol switching overhead).",
        "Scalability claims (1,000+ nodes) are ambitious but not fully substantiated.",
        "Potential high computational overhead from dynamic scheduling."

        "How will the system handle extreme heterogeneity in hardware capabilities?",
        "What are the fallback mechanisms if the dynamic workload redistribution fails?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "Potential overhead from dynamic protocol switching may offset gains.",
        "RL-based scheduling may require significant tuning and computational resources.",
        "Scalability beyond 1,000 nodes is untested and may face unforeseen bottlenecks.",
