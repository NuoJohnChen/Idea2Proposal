    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a compositional framework to jointly optimize fairness, safety, and privacy in AI systems. It hypothesizes that these dimensions are interdependent and proposes novel algorithmic coordination to mitigate trade-offs. The method includes fairness-privacy synergy, safety-aware fairness, and unified optimization, with a detailed experiment plan covering benchmarking, algorithmic development, real-world evaluation, and human audits.",
