    "Summary": "The proposal introduces dynamic latent structures to enhance the expressivity and efficiency of generative models, targeting diffusion models, autoregressive transformers, and hybrid VAEs/GANs. It proposes dynamic noise scheduling, adaptive autoregressive ordering, and hybrid latent spaces, with a comprehensive experimental plan for validation.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement identifying gaps in current generative models.",
        "Innovative hypothesis with potential for significant impact.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan covering multiple aspects of evaluation.",
        "Strong theoretical foundation with references to relevant literature."

    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lack of detailed discussion on the feasibility of integrating all three dynamic components.",
        "Insufficient risk assessment regarding computational overhead and training stability.",
        "Limited concrete details on implementation and optimization of dynamic mechanisms."
