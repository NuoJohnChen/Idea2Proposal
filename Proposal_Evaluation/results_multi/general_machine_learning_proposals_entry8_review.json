    "Summary": "The proposal aims to improve machine learning robustness to distribution shifts by leveraging causal invariance and disentangling causal from spurious features. It combines adversarial training, self-supervised learning, and test-time adaptation, with a comprehensive validation plan including synthetic and real-world benchmarks.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-motivated problem statement.",
        "Innovative combination of adversarial training, self-supervised learning, and test-time adaptation.",
        "Comprehensive and rigorous experiment plan covering synthetic and real-world datasets.",
        "Potential for significant impact given the relevance of the problem."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Feasibility of generating meaningful adversarial environments is uncertain.",
        "Novelty is somewhat incremental, building on existing work.",
        "Computational overhead of the proposed framework is not thoroughly discussed.",
        "Limited discussion on generalizability beyond specific domains like medical imaging."

        "What are the computational costs of test-time adaptation, and how will they be managed in large-scale deployments?",
        "How will the method handle cases where causal and spurious features are deeply entangled?",
        "What are the fallback mechanisms if test-time adaptation fails to improve performance?"
