    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a unified framework to address fairness, safety, and privacy in AI systems through a co-design approach. It hypothesizes that integrating these objectives into the training pipeline can achieve better trade-offs. The proposed method includes intersectional fairness optimization, proactive safety verification, and context-aware privacy, with experiments planned on benchmark datasets and a healthcare prediction task.",
