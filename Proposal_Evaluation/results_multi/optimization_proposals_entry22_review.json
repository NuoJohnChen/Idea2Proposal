    "Summary": "The proposal aims to improve adaptive gradient methods by introducing dynamic regularization and trajectory-aware adaptation. It targets limitations in current methods like static hyperparameters and suboptimal regularization interactions. The proposed method includes gradient coherence-guided regularization and trajectory memory for momentum adaptation, with a focus on hardware-efficient implementation.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement with well-articulated limitations of current methods.",
        "Innovative hypothesis combining dynamic regularization and trajectory-aware adaptation.",
        "Comprehensive experimental plan covering synthetic benchmarks, deep learning ablations, and hardware benchmarking."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Novelty of core ideas is not fully justified; dynamic regularization and trajectory memory are clever but not groundbreaking.",
        "Execution plan lacks detailed technical descriptions and feasibility analysis.",
        "Experimental validation could be more rigorous, with missing critical analyses like ablation studies."
