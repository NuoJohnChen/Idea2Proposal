    "Summary": "The proposal introduces dynamic latent structures for generative models to balance sample quality and computational efficiency. It addresses limitations in current models by proposing adaptive computation and content-aware generation pathways. The method includes dynamic diffusion scheduling, learned generation pathways, and efficiency-aware training, with a detailed experiment plan.",
