    "Summary": "The proposal aims to optimize communication and memory efficiency in distributed deep learning (DDL) by introducing a hybrid communication strategy and memory-aware scheduling. It targets inefficiencies in existing frameworks like PyTorch\u2019s DDP and Horovod, proposing a unified software stack called DistOpt. The method includes topology-aware communication, memory-efficient scheduling, and integration with existing backends. The experiment plan covers benchmarking, scalability testing, fault tolerance, and ablation studies.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement with relevant citations.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan with multiple validation steps.",
        "Detailed proposed method with specific components (communication protocol, memory scheduling).",
        "Strong motivation grounded in existing literature."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks discussion on potential technical challenges (e.g., overhead of dynamic protocol switching).",
        "Intellectual depth is solid but not groundbreaking; builds on existing work.",
        "Baseline comparisons could be more explicitly justified.",
        "Feasibility of real-time network profiling is not thoroughly addressed."

        "What are the expected trade-offs between memory efficiency and computational overhead in the proposed memory-aware scheduling?",
        "How will the proposed method scale beyond the 64-GPU cluster mentioned in the experiment plan?",
        "How will the system handle scenarios where network topology changes dynamically during training?"
