    "Summary": "The proposal introduces TopoGNN, a unified framework for integrating geometric and topological learning in graph neural networks (GNNs). It aims to address limitations in handling non-Euclidean geometries and higher-order topological structures by combining geometric graph embeddings, differentiable topological features, and a hybrid architecture. The experiment plan includes validation of geometric adaptivity, benchmarking topological robustness, scaling to real-world hybrid data, theoretical analysis, and efficiency optimization.",
