    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a hybrid computational model combining hierarchical reinforcement learning (RL) and spiking neural networks (SNNs) to understand cognitive control through oscillatory dynamics in the brain. It plans to validate the model using EEG/MEG data and clinical data from ADHD patients, with potential therapeutic implications.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Ambitious and intellectually deep hypothesis linking oscillatory dynamics to cognitive control.",
        "Comprehensive experimental plan including model development, neural data fitting, and clinical validation.",
        "Strong potential for clinical translation, particularly in understanding ADHD."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Feasibility of integrating hierarchical RL, SNNs, and oscillatory dynamics into a cohesive model is questionable.",
        "Lacks detailed discussion of technical challenges and potential pitfalls in model fitting and validation.",
        "Overly ambitious experimental plan may not be feasible within typical research timelines."

        "How will the model's predictions be validated against empirical data, and what metrics will be used?",
        "What are the fallback plans if the model fails to predict clinical data?"

    "Limitations": [
        "High computational complexity may limit the feasibility of the proposed model.",
        "Potential difficulties in accurately fitting the model to empirical neural data.",
        "The clinical validation phase may face challenges in recruiting and testing ADHD patients.",
        "Integration of diverse components (SNNs, RL, oscillatory dynamics) may pose technical challenges."
