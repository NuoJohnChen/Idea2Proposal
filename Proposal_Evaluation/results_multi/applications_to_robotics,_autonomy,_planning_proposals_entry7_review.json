    "Summary": "The proposal aims to enhance autonomous navigation by integrating hierarchical world models with uncertainty-aware learning. It addresses limitations in current systems, such as brittleness to partial observability and distribution shifts, by combining uncertainty-aware hierarchical modeling, temporal abstraction, and sim-to-real transfer. The proposed method includes an uncertainty-aware world model, hierarchical planning with subgoals, and adaptation via meta-learning. The experiment plan is comprehensive, covering validation of uncertainty modeling, hierarchical planning, sim-to-real transfer, ablation studies, and benchmarking against state-of-the-art methods.",
