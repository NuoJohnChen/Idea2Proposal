    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a hybrid optimization approach combining zeroth-order and first-order methods for non-smooth objectives, aiming to improve upon the limitations of existing methods. It includes a dynamic switching mechanism, efficient zeroth-order gradient estimation, and scalable implementation for high dimensions. The experiment plan covers synthetic benchmarks, reinforcement learning, adversarial training, and computational efficiency.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement highlighting the limitations of current optimization methods.",
        "Plausible hypothesis that hybrid methods can outperform pure zeroth-order or first-order methods.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan covering multiple application domains.",
        "Innovative approach with potential for significant impact in optimization."

    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks detailed discussion on the challenges of estimating local smoothness in high-dimensional spaces.",
        "Vague theoretical analysis section without clear assumptions or expected results.",
        "Potential computational overhead of the switching mechanism is not addressed.",
        "Limited discussion on how to handle cases where neither method performs well."
