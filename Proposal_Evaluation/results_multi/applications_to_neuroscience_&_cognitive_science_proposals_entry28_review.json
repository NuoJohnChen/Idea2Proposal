    "Summary": "The proposal aims to integrate biologically inspired dynamic attention mechanisms (phase-dependent attention, neuromodulatory gating, adaptive timescales) into computational models to improve alignment with neural data and cognitive performance. The method combines deep learning with neurobiological principles, and the experiment plan includes synthetic task validation, neural data alignment, behavioral benchmarking, ablation studies, and clinical relevance testing.",
