    "Summary": "The proposal aims to use deep learning, specifically graph neural networks (GNNs) and attention mechanisms, to accelerate the discovery of high-entropy alloys (HEAs) with tailored mechanical properties. It addresses the limitations of traditional trial-and-error methods and DFT calculations by proposing a scalable, data-driven framework that integrates physics-informed features with data-driven representations. The method includes data curation, representation learning, and active learning for experimental validation, with a detailed step-by-step experiment plan.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement.",
        "Strong hypothesis grounded in the integration of GNNs and attention mechanisms with physics-informed features.",
        "Detailed and thorough step-by-step experiment plan.",
        "High execution credibility with a focus on active learning and iterative optimization."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Novelty of combining GNNs with physics-informed features for HEAs is not entirely unprecedented.",
        "Lacks detailed discussion on potential technical challenges (e.g., data scarcity, interpretability of attention mechanisms).",
        "Baseline comparisons could be more explicitly justified.",
        "Evaluation metrics could be more comprehensive (e.g., including uncertainty quantification)."
