    "Summary": "The proposal introduces an adaptive framework for reinforcement learning that dynamically balances model-free and model-based learning using uncertainty-aware dynamics modeling and meta-learned gating. It aims to improve sample efficiency and mitigate compounding errors in long-horizon tasks. The experiment plan includes validation on toy environments, continuous control tasks, long-horizon tasks, high-dimensional spaces, and real-world robotics.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-motivated problem statement.",
        "Novel hypothesis grounded in prior work.",
        "Detailed and comprehensive proposed method.",
        "Thorough experiment plan covering multiple domains."

    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks detailed discussion on computational overhead of meta-learned gating.",
        "Scalability of ensemble-based uncertainty estimation not fully addressed.",
        "Validation plan could include more rigorous ablation studies."
