Decision: Accept
Weaknesses: Insufficient technical depth regarding integration challenges (e.g., memory interference, computational overhead)., Lacks detailed risk mitigation strategies for conflicting objectives (adaptation vs. retention)., Validation plan needs stronger emphasis on failure modes and edge cases., Overly optimistic about seamless integration of complex components without deeper feasibility analysis.
