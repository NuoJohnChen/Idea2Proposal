    "Summary": "The proposal introduces an adaptive gradient method for non-stationary optimization problems, combining input-dependent momentum decay, curvature-aware step sizing, and memory-efficient adaptation. It aims to address limitations of existing methods like Adam in dynamic environments such as meta-learning and adversarial training.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear identification of a gap in existing adaptive gradient methods.",
        "Innovative combination of input-dependent momentum decay, curvature-aware step sizing, and memory-efficient adaptation.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan covering synthetic benchmarks, meta-learning, adversarial training, and large-scale language model fine-tuning.",
        "Well-motivated hypothesis grounded in practical challenges."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lack of detail on theoretical analysis, particularly for non-convex objectives.",
        "Vague description of the gating mechanism for sparse updates, raising questions about computational efficiency.",
        "Limited discussion on potential failure modes or scenarios where the method might underperform."

        "What are the theoretical guarantees for non-convex objectives, and how do they compare to existing methods?",
        "Can you provide more details on the gating mechanism for sparse updates and its impact on training throughput?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "The method's performance may degrade in scenarios with extremely rapid or chaotic changes in the loss landscape.",
        "The computational overhead of curvature-aware step sizing might offset the benefits of memory-efficient adaptation in some cases."
