    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a unified framework for interpreting and visualizing learned features in deep neural networks (DNNs) by combining disentanglement metrics, cross-layer similarity analysis, and an interactive dashboard. It targets the opacity of DNN representations and seeks to quantify disentanglement, visualize feature composition, and identify task-critical dependencies. The experiment plan includes synthetic datasets, layer-wise analysis, cross-model comparisons, human evaluation, and downstream applications.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Addresses a critical and timely problem in deep learning interpretability.",
        "Combines multiple advanced techniques (InfoGAN, CKA, UMAP) into a cohesive framework.",
        "Proposes a practical, interactive dashboard for real-time exploration of large-scale models.",
        "Grounds the hypothesis in recent literature.",
        "Includes a detailed step-by-step experiment plan with synthetic and real-world validation."
