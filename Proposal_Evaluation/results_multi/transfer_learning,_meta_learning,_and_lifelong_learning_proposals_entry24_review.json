    "Summary": "The proposal seeks to unify transfer, meta, and lifelong learning into a single framework for continual adaptation. It hypothesizes that combining meta-learned inductive biases, dynamic parameter isolation, and task-aware memory replay can outperform existing isolated paradigms. The proposed method includes meta-transfer via gradient-based embeddings, lifelong adaptation with dynamic parameter masks, and memory-augmented replay with task graphs. The experimental plan involves benchmarking against isolated paradigms, ablating framework components, evaluating scalability, analyzing cross-paradigm synergies, and real-world deployment.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement.",
        "Ambitious and intellectually deep hypothesis.",
