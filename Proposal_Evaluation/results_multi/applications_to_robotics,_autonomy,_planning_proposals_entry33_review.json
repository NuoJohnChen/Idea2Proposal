    "Summary": "The proposal aims to enhance autonomous navigation by integrating hierarchical world models with uncertainty quantification using Bayesian neural networks. It addresses limitations in current modular and learning-based approaches, proposing a three-part framework involving hierarchical latent dynamics, uncertainty-aware planning, and Sim2Real transfer. The experiment plan includes validation on synthetic benchmarks, real-world datasets, and hardware deployment.",
