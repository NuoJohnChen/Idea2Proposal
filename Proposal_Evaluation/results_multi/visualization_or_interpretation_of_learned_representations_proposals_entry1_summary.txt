Weaknesses: Feasibility of integrating diffusion models with causal graphs is not fully discussed, and the technical challenges are understated., Scalability of human-in-the-loop evaluation could be a challenge, especially for large datasets., Limited discussion on computational costs and resource requirements for training diffusion models., Execution plan lacks detailed risk mitigation strategies for potential technical hurdles.
