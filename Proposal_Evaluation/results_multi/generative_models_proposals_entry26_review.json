    "Summary": "The proposal aims to improve controllability and faithfulness in long-form text generation by developing a hybrid architecture that combines autoregressive LLMs with dynamic control modules. The approach involves latent control space integration, reinforcement learning for dynamic constraint satisfaction, and hierarchical control for efficient long-form generation. The experiment plan includes validation on short-text tasks, scaling to long-form generation, RL fine-tuning ablations, benchmarking, and real-world deployment.",
