    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop neural operators for accelerated simulation of multiscale physical systems, addressing computational bottlenecks in traditional numerical methods. It introduces three key innovations: multiscale kernel integration, physics-constrained training, and operator distillation. The experiment plan includes benchmarking on canonical PDEs, molecular dynamics acceleration, multiphysics systems, ablation studies, and real-world validation.",
