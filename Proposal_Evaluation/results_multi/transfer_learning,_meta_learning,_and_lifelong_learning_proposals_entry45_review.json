    "Summary": "The proposal aims to unify transfer, meta, and lifelong learning into a single framework, addressing key limitations in each paradigm. It proposes a shared latent representation space modulated by task context, combining hypernetworks, diffusion-based memory, and contrastive objectives. The experiment plan includes benchmarking against baselines, ablation studies, cross-modal tasks, efficiency measurements, and theoretical analysis.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement.",
        "Ambitious and novel hypothesis with potential for high impact.",
        "Thorough experiment plan with multiple benchmarks and ablation studies.",
        "Strong scientific rigor with detailed validation strategies."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "High technical risk due to the complexity of integrating multiple advanced techniques.",
        "Feasibility of the unified system is uncertain.",
        "Theoretical analysis seems overly optimistic given the complexity.",
        "Lacks discussion of potential failure modes and limitations."
