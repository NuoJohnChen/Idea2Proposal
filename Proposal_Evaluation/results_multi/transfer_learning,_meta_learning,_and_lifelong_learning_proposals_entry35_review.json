    "Summary": "The proposal introduces UCAN, a unified framework for continual adaptation combining meta-transfer with hypernetworks, sparse memory replay, and adversarial alignment. It targets limitations in current transfer, meta, and lifelong learning methods, aiming for efficient knowledge transfer and reduced forgetting.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement.",
        "Ambitious hypothesis with potential for significant impact.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan including validation, lifelong learning, cross-domain transfer, and ablation studies.",
        "Strong scientific rigor with planned comparisons to state-of-the-art methods.",
        "Integration of multiple advanced techniques (hypernetworks, sparse memory replay, adversarial alignment)."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks detailed discussion on computational overhead and scalability.",
