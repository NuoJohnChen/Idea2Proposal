    "Summary": "The proposal introduces Contextualized Learning Dynamics (CLD) to enhance meta-learning by dynamically adjusting learning strategies based on task-specific context. It combines theoretical formalization, stability guarantees, and scalable implementation, with experiments planned across synthetic tasks, benchmark datasets, robotics simulations, theoretical analysis, and human-in-the-loop evaluation.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement highlighting limitations of current meta-learning frameworks.",
        "Strong theoretical grounding in neuroscience and hierarchical Bayesian models.",
        "Ambitious and comprehensive proposed method combining theoretical, stability, and scalability aspects.",
        "Detailed experimental plan covering synthetic, benchmark, robotics, theoretical, and human-in-the-loop evaluations."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lack of clarity on how technical challenges (e.g., adversarial training of the critic network) will be addressed.",
        "Experimental plan could benefit from more explicit discussion of baseline comparisons and potential pitfalls.",
        "Theoretical analysis assumptions (e.g., Lipschitz continuity, bounded task diversity) may not hold in all real-world scenarios.",
        "Novelty is incremental; similar ideas have been explored in hierarchical RL and Bayesian optimization.",
        "Overly optimistic about stability guarantees and scalability via implicit gradients."

        "What are the specific baseline methods that will be compared against in each experimental setting?",
        "How will the synthetic EHR data for human-in-the-loop evaluation be generated to ensure realism and relevance?",
        "How will the context encoder handle high-dimensional or noisy task descriptors?",
        "What are the fallback mechanisms if the Lyapunov stability constraints fail?"

    "Limitations": [
        "Theoretical assumptions may limit applicability in highly non-stationary or unbounded task distributions.",
        "Scalability of implicit gradients in high-dimensional task spaces is not fully explored.",
