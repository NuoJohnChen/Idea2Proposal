    "Summary": "The proposal introduces Adaptive Gradient Meta-Optimization (AGMO), a framework to enhance gradient-based optimization methods by integrating meta-learning to handle non-stationary objectives. It aims to dynamically adjust optimizer hyperparameters based on real-time feedback, addressing limitations of existing methods like Adam and SGD in dynamic settings. The experiment plan covers synthetic benchmarks, deep learning, reinforcement learning, theoretical analysis, and large-scale language model fine-tuning.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Highly ambitious and novel idea integrating meta-learning with optimization, potentially opening new research directions.",
        "Clear and compelling problem statement that identifies a significant gap in current optimization methods.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan that spans synthetic tasks, deep learning, and reinforcement learning, demonstrating broad applicability."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Technical details on the meta-learner's architecture and training process are sparse, raising questions about implementation feasibility.",
        "Limited discussion on computational overhead and scalability, which could be critical for real-world adoption.",
        "Theoretical analysis is mentioned but lacks depth in justifying stability guarantees or regret bounds.",
        "Experiment plan, while broad, does not sufficiently address potential failure modes or robustness under extreme non-stationarity."

        "Can you provide more detailed theoretical justifications for stability guarantees under non-stationarity?",
        "How will the method scale to very large models, given the additional overhead of the meta-learner?",
        "What are the expected computational costs, and how will they be mitigated?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "High computational overhead due to dynamic adaptation may limit practicality.",
        "Risk of instability in the meta-learner's adjustments without robust theoretical guarantees.",
        "Scalability to large-scale models remains unproven and could be a significant bottleneck."
