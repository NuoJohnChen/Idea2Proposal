    "Summary": "The proposal seeks to unify metric learning, kernel learning, and sparse coding into a joint framework for robust representation learning. It hypothesizes that integrating these methods can overcome their individual limitations, offering scalable and interpretable representations. The proposed method involves kernelized metric learning, sparse coding regularization, and scalable optimization techniques. The experiment plan includes synthetic data validation, benchmarking on standard datasets, scalability testing, downstream task evaluation, and ablation studies.",
