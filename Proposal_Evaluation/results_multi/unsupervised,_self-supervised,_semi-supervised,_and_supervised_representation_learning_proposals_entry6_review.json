    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a unified framework for representation learning that dynamically combines unsupervised, self-supervised, semi-supervised, and supervised paradigms. It hypothesizes that a shared representation space can adapt to varying label availability and task complexity. The method involves a multi-task loss formulation, adaptive representation fusion, and semi-supervised adaptation. Experiments include benchmarking isolated paradigms, validating the unified framework, evaluating semi-supervised adaptation, scaling to large datasets, and analyzing representation quality.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Ambitious and timely research question addressing a clear gap in representation learning.",
        "Well-structured problem statement and motivation.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan with ablation studies and scalability tests.",
        "Integration of multiple advanced techniques (meta-learning, mixture-of-experts, uncertainty-aware pseudo-labeling)."

    "Weaknesses": [
        "Under-specification of technical challenges (e.g., dynamic loss balancing stability, conflicting signals).",
