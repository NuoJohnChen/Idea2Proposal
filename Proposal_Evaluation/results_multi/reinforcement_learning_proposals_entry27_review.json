    "Summary": "The proposal aims to improve the sample efficiency of reinforcement learning (RL) by introducing adaptive model-based priors. It hypothesizes that a learned gating mechanism can dynamically adjust the reliance on model-based updates, combining the sample efficiency of model-based RL with the asymptotic performance of model-free methods. The proposed method includes adaptive model-value integration, uncertainty-aware model learning, and efficient prior injection. The experiment plan covers validation on toy domains, high-dimensional tasks, robustness tests, and real-world feasibility.",
