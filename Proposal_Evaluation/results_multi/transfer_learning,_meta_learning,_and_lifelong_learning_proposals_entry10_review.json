    "Summary": "The proposal seeks to unify transfer learning, meta-learning, and lifelong learning into a single framework for continual adaptation. It proposes a modular architecture with shared representations and dynamic task-specific adaptation mechanisms to overcome the limitations of existing paradigms. The experiment plan includes benchmark initialization, dynamic adaptation evaluation, scalability testing, real-world deployment, and ablation studies.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement.",
        "Ambitious and plausible hypothesis.",
        "Detailed experiment plan with multiple stages of evaluation.",
        "Integration of multiple learning paradigms into a unified framework."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks depth in addressing potential technical challenges (e.g., computational overhead, scalability of gating mechanism).",
        "Insufficient discussion on baseline selection and potential biases in the validation plan.",
        "Limited discussion on risk mitigation strategies."

        "How will the baseline selection ensure fair comparison with existing methods?",
        "How will conflicts between rapid adaptation (meta-learning) and stability (lifelong learning) be resolved?",
        "What specific metrics will be used to quantify forward/backward transfer?"

    "Limitations": [
        "Potential high computational cost due to dynamic task adaptation.",
