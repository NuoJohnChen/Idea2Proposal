    "Summary": "The proposal seeks to unify representation learning paradigms (unsupervised, self-supervised, semi-supervised, and supervised) through dynamic gradient fusion and latent space alignment. It aims to address the fragmentation in current methods by harmonizing gradients from diverse objectives and ensuring compatibility across paradigms. The experiment plan includes validation, testing, benchmarking, scaling, and ablation studies.",
