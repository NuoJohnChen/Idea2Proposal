    "Summary": "The proposal aims to improve machine learning model robustness under distribution shifts by combining causal feature disentanglement, dynamic adaptation via meta-learning, and a unified training framework. The authors plan to validate their approach on synthetic benchmarks, domain generalization tasks, and real-world deployments.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-motivated problem statement with relevant citations.",
        "Ambitious and theoretically sound hypothesis combining multiple advanced techniques.",
        "Comprehensive experimental plan covering synthetic, domain generalization, and real-world scenarios."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks detailed discussion on computational complexity and feasibility of combining causal disentanglement with dynamic adaptation.",
        "Experimental plan could benefit from more detailed risk mitigation strategies.",
        "Limited discussion on potential failure modes of the proposed hybrid approach."
