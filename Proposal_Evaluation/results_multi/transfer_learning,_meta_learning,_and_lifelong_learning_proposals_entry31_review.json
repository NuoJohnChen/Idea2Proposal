    "Summary": "The proposal seeks to unify transfer learning, meta-learning, and lifelong learning into a single framework, addressing rapid adaptation, forgetting-resistant consolidation, and cross-domain transferability. It proposes a dynamic memory-augmented meta-learner with task-aware representation modulation, sparse memory replay, and a disentangled evaluation protocol.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement.",
        "Ambitious and original hypothesis with potential for high impact.",
        "Technically sound proposed method combining hypernetworks, sparse memory replay, and disentangled evaluation.",
        "Detailed experiment plan with multiple validation steps."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Complexity and ambitious scope may pose execution challenges.",
        "Lacks discussion on computational resources and scalability.",
        "Real-world robotics deployment seems overly ambitious without clear feasibility analysis.",
        "Potential risks and failure modes are not thoroughly addressed."

    "Limitations": [
        "High computational cost due to the combination of hypernetworks and memory replay.",
