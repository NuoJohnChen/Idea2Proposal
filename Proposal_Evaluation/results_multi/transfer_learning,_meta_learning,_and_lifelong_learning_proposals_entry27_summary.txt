Weaknesses: High risk of computational intractability due to the complexity of integrating three paradigms., Insufficient detail on how conflicting learning objectives will be balanced in practice., Deployment to resource-constrained settings may be unrealistic given the proposed architecture., Lack of concrete fallback plans if key components (e.g., memory sparsification) underperform.
