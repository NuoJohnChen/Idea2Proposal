    "Summary": "The proposal aims to improve machine learning model robustness under distribution shift by combining self-supervised learning, adversarial training, and dynamic regularization to disentangle causal and non-causal features. It includes a comprehensive experiment plan with synthetic and real-world benchmarks, ablation studies, and scalability tests.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-motivated problem statement.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan with synthetic and real-world evaluations.",
        "Strong scientific rigor with planned ablation studies and comparisons to strong baselines.",
        "Potential for real-world impact, especially in healthcare applications."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks groundbreaking novelty; the combination of techniques is incremental.",
        "Insufficient detail on how dynamic regularization adapts to feature 'shiftiness'.",
        "Adversarial component's specificity to non-causal features is not well-explained.",
        "No discussion of computational costs or potential scalability issues."

    "Questions": [

        "What specific adversarial techniques will be used to target non-causal features?",
        "What are the expected computational overheads of the proposed method compared to baselines?",
        "What are the potential failure modes of the proposed method, and how will they be addressed?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "The method may struggle with highly complex feature spaces where causal and non-causal features are deeply entangled.",
        "Dynamic regularization might introduce additional hyperparameters that are difficult to tune.",
        "Scalability to very large datasets (e.g., ImageNet) is not guaranteed and could be computationally expensive."
