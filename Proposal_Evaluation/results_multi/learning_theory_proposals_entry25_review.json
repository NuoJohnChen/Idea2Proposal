    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a theoretical framework for provable feature learning in deep neural networks, combining theoretical analysis with empirical validation. It focuses on feature learning dynamics, implicit regularization, and generalization bounds, with a detailed experiment plan to validate these concepts.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement and motivation.",
        "Strong theoretical foundation with references to recent work.",
        "Detailed and structured experiment plan.",
        "Ambitious goal of unifying theoretical understanding with empirical success."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "The theoretical framework may be overly optimistic given the complexity of deep learning.",
        "Lacks discussion on potential technical challenges and risks, such as scalability of dynamic NTK to large models.",
        "Empirical validation plan may not fully capture the complexity of real-world datasets and models."

    "Questions": [
        "How will the dynamic NTK framework scale to very large models like Transformers?",
        "What are the specific technical challenges in extending the NTK paradigm to account for feature learning?",
        "How will the proposed framework handle non-stationary data distributions in real-world scenarios?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "Scalability of theoretical frameworks to large-scale models.",
        "Potential oversimplification of real-world data complexity in empirical validation.",
        "Dependence on synthetic datasets for initial validation may limit generalizability."
