    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a framework for dynamic, intervention-aware causal reasoning, addressing limitations in current neural causal models. It combines differentiable causal discovery, intervention-aware memory, and temporal causal reinforcement learning to infer latent causal graphs, simulate counterfactuals, and generalize across distribution shifts. The experiment plan includes synthetic benchmarks, healthcare simulations, robotics, scalability tests, and real-world deployment.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement.",
        "Strong motivation and hypothesis with potential for broad impact.",
        "Innovative combination of differentiable causal discovery, intervention-aware memory, and temporal causal RL.",
        "Comprehensive and rigorous experiment plan covering multiple domains and validation methods."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Feasibility of integrating all three components into a unified framework is a significant challenge.",
        "Limited discussion on potential technical hurdles and mitigation strategies.",
        "Execution plan could benefit from more detailed risk analysis.",
        "Ethical considerations, particularly for healthcare deployment, are not explicitly addressed."

    "Questions": [
        "How will the model handle cases where the latent confounders are highly entangled with the observed variables?",
        "What are the computational limits of the proposed memory module, especially in high-dimensional settings?",
        "How will the RL agent balance exploration and exploitation when reasoning about causal dependencies?",
        "How will the proposed framework handle extremely high-dimensional data (e.g., >1000 variables)?",
        "What are the specific mechanisms for ensuring the interpretability of the learned causal graphs?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "Integration of three complex components may introduce unforeseen technical challenges.",
        "Scalability to very high-dimensional data (e.g., 1000+ variables) is not fully demonstrated.",
        "Real-world deployment may face regulatory and ethical hurdles, especially in healthcare.",
        "Robustness of the memory module under noisy or incomplete intervention histories is untested."
