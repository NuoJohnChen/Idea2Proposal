    "Summary": "The proposal aims to unify metric learning, kernel learning, and sparse coding into a single framework for robust representation learning. It hypothesizes that a joint optimization approach will outperform existing methods in generalization, interpretability, and scalability. The proposed method includes a joint optimization objective, adaptive kernel design, and efficient optimization techniques. The experiment plan involves synthetic data validation, benchmarking on image data, scalability testing, downstream task evaluation, and interpretability analysis.",
