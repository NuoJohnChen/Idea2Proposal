    "Summary": "The proposal introduces Causal Neural Modules (CNM), a novel framework to integrate causal reasoning into neural networks. It aims to address the limitations of current models in handling causal relationships by leveraging modular architectures, intervention-based training, and counterfactual reasoning. The experiment plan includes validation on synthetic benchmarks, real-world applications, and scalability tests.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and compelling problem statement highlighting the gap in current deep learning models.",
        "Innovative approach combining modular causal architectures with neural networks.",
        "Detailed experiment plan covering synthetic and real-world benchmarks.",
        "Strong grounding in recent causal inference literature."
