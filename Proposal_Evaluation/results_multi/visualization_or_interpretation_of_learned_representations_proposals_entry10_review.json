    "Summary": "The proposal aims to enhance the interpretability of deep neural networks by combining topological analysis with dynamic visualization. It introduces methods for topological feature visualization, disentanglement via latent traversal, and an interactive visualization framework. The experiment plan includes benchmarking, validation, scaling to language models, downstream utility evaluation, and open-source tool release.",
