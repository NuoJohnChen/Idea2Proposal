    "Summary": "The proposal introduces dynamic latent structures for generative models to balance expressivity and efficiency. It includes adaptive latent dimensionality, hierarchical latent graphs, and efficient sampling via latent subsampling. The experiment plan covers synthetic data, image generation, video and 3D data, efficiency gains, and downstream tasks.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement.",
        "Innovative hypothesis with potential for significant impact.",
