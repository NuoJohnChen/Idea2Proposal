Weaknesses: Lack of detailed discussion on potential integration challenges between FNOs and GNNs., Unclear feasibility of scaling to very large systems (>1,000 atoms) with current computational resources., Limited discussion of alternative approaches or contingency plans if the hybrid architecture underperforms., Potential risks in preserving physical symmetries during training are not thoroughly addressed.
