    "Summary": "The proposal introduces Dynamic Latent Generative Models (DLGM), a framework that dynamically adapts latent structures to improve the efficiency and quality of generative models. It combines adaptive latent hierarchy, variable-rate diffusion, and efficient sampling via latent pruning. The experiment plan includes validation on synthetic data, image generation tasks, and extension to video and 3D data.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Innovative approach to generative modeling with dynamic latent structures.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan covering multiple data modalities.",
        "Clear problem statement and compelling hypothesis.",
        "Integration of multiple novel components (adaptive latent hierarchy, variable-rate diffusion, latent pruning)."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lack of detailed discussion on implementation challenges, especially for the stochastic gating mechanism and gradient clipping strategy.",
        "Potential risks in training stability and robustness are not fully addressed.",
        "Experiment plan could benefit from more emphasis on ablation studies to isolate the contributions of each dynamic component."

        "How will the router's importance scores be calibrated to avoid over-pruning critical latent dimensions?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "Potential instability in training due to dynamic latent structures.",
        "Risk of over-pruning leading to loss of fine-grained details.",
        "Generalization challenges across diverse data modalities (e.g., video, 3D)."
