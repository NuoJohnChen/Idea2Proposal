Overall Quality: 6
Argumentative Cohesion: 7
Intellectual Depth: 6
Execution Credibility: 6
Scientific Rigor: 7
Decision: Reject
Weaknesses: Lacks depth in addressing computational overhead of MCTS with neural models., Uncertainty quantification reliability in real-world scenarios needs stronger justification., Baseline comparisons could be more rigorous (e.g., inclusion of state-of-the-art hybrid planners)., Incremental advancement over existing hybrid approaches, lacking paradigm-shifting novelty.
