    "Summary": "The proposal introduces Adaptive Model-Based Priors (AMBP), a novel RL framework that dynamically balances model-based planning and model-free learning using uncertainty-aware dynamics models and an adaptive gating mechanism. The goal is to improve sample efficiency and generalization while maintaining computational efficiency.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement highlighting limitations of current RL methods.",
        "Innovative components like uncertainty-aware dynamics models and adaptive gating.",
        "Detailed experiment plan covering validation, testing, and benchmarking.",
        "Well-structured narrative with logical flow from problem to solution."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lack of groundbreaking insight; builds heavily on existing work.",
        "Feasibility concerns about the adaptive gating mechanism.",
        "Computational overhead of hierarchical learning approach not fully addressed.",
        "Limited discussion on potential failure modes and mitigation strategies."

    "Questions": [
        "How will the gating mechanism be trained to ensure it reliably switches between model-based and model-free learning?",
        "What are the potential failure modes of the uncertainty-aware dynamics models, and how will they be addressed?",
        "How will the computational overhead of the hierarchical learning approach be minimized?",
        "What metrics will be used to evaluate the robustness of the gating mechanism?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "Potential high computational cost due to ensemble of dynamics models and hierarchical learning.",
        "Risk of the gating mechanism failing to switch appropriately in high-uncertainty states.",
        "Generalization to out-of-distribution tasks may be limited by the quality of the uncertainty estimates."
