{
    "Summary": "The proposal presents a framework for integrating fairness, safety, and privacy in AI systems, addressing their interdependencies. It includes a unified metric design, dynamic adaptation, and stakeholder-aware auditing, with experiments planned on benchmark datasets and real-world deployment.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Comprehensive problem statement highlighting critical gaps in current AI systems.",
        "Ambitious and well-structured proposed method with three innovative components.",
        "Detailed experimental plan covering benchmark trade-offs, validation, dynamic monitoring, participatory auditing, and real-world deployment.",
        "Strong emphasis on stakeholder involvement, particularly marginalized communities, in the auditing process."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "The intellectual depth is somewhat limited, as the proposal builds on existing work without a clear paradigm-shifting insight.",
        "Feasibility concerns, especially with the real-world deployment and participatory auditing components.",
        "The unified metric design, while theoretically sound, may face practical challenges in implementation.",
        "Lack of detailed discussion on potential technical barriers and solutions for the dynamic adaptation component."

    "Questions": [
        "How will the participatory auditing protocols ensure diverse and representative stakeholder participation?",
        "What specific mechanisms will be used to balance the trade-offs between fairness, safety, and privacy in the unified metric design?",
        "How will the dynamic adaptation component handle real-time data streams with high variability?",
        "What are the fallback mechanisms if the real-world deployment encounters unforeseen challenges?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "Potential difficulty in achieving Pareto-efficient solutions due to inherent trade-offs.",
        "Real-world deployment may face resistance from institutions due to complexity and cost.",
        "Participatory auditing may be time-consuming and difficult to scale.",
        "Dynamic adaptation may introduce latency in model updates, affecting real-time performance."
