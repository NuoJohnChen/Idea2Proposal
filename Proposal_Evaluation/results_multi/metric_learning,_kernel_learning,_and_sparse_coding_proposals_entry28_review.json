    "Summary": "The proposal aims to unify metric learning, kernel learning, and sparse coding into a single framework to address their individual limitations. It proposes three key innovations: adaptive metric-kernel fusion, sparse regularization, and end-to-end deep integration. The experiment plan includes synthetic data validation, benchmarking on standard datasets, ablation studies, real-world applications, and scalability tests.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Novel unification of three foundational learning paradigms with clear theoretical motivation",
        "Well-structured validation plan progressing from controlled to real-world scenarios",
        "Addresses important practical limitations (noise robustness, scalability, interpretability)"
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Implementation details for core innovations (e.g., learnable kernel parameterization) remain underspecified",
        "No concrete analysis of optimization challenges for joint sparsity/metric learning",
        "Scalability claims lack implementation specifics for distributed training"
