    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a unified multimodal representation learning framework that bridges vision, audio, and language through cross-modal alignment. It addresses limitations in current methods by proposing geometric consistency, contrastive learning with weak supervision, and modality-invariant attention. The experiment plan includes validation, benchmarking, ablation studies, scaling laws, and real-world deployment.",
