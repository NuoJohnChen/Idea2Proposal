    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a unified framework for interpreting neural representations by combining geometric disentanglement (Principal Geodesic Analysis) with causal intervention techniques. It addresses the opacity of deep neural networks by introducing new interpretability metrics and validating them through synthetic benchmarking, layer-wise feature analysis, and human-in-the-loop studies.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement highlighting the limitations of current interpretability methods.",
        "Ambitious and novel hypothesis linking feature entanglement and non-orthogonal basis functions to interpretability challenges.",
        "Comprehensive experimental plan that includes synthetic benchmarking, layer-wise analysis, and human validation.",
        "Potential to significantly advance the field of interpretable AI by introducing new metrics and methods."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Feasibility concerns regarding the integration of Principal Geodesic Analysis and causal interventions.",
        "Lack of detailed discussion on how the proposed interpretability metrics will be validated against existing methods.",
        "Potential challenges in scaling the method to larger and more complex architectures.",
        "Limited discussion on potential biases or limitations of the human-in-the-loop validation."
