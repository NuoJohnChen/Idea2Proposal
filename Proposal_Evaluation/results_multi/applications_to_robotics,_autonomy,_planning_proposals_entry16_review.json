    "Summary": "The proposal aims to integrate learned world models with hierarchical planning to improve robotic autonomy in dynamic, unstructured environments. It hypothesizes that combining neural representations with symbolic constraints can achieve both generalization and robustness. The method involves training a differentiable world model with symbolic priors, developing a bi-level planner, and enabling online adaptation via meta-learning. The experiment plan includes validation, benchmarking, generalization tests, real-world robustness evaluation, and ablation studies.",
