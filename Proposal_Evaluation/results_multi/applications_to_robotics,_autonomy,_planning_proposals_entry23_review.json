    "Summary": "The proposal aims to enhance autonomous navigation by integrating hierarchical world models with uncertainty-aware learning. It addresses limitations in current modular and end-to-end approaches, proposing a two-level latent dynamics model with explicit uncertainty estimation. The method combines transformer-based high-level planning with recurrent SSM-based low-level control, trained via variational inference and risk-sensitive objectives. Experiments include simulation benchmarking, uncertainty calibration, hardware validation, and ablation studies.",
