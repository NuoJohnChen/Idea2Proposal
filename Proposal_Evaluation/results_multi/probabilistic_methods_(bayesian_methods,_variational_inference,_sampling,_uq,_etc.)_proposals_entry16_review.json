    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a scalable and robust probabilistic inference framework by combining expressive variational families, adaptive sampling techniques, and a modular UQ layer for deep learning. It addresses the limitations of current probabilistic methods in terms of computational inefficiency, scalability, and integration with deep learning. The proposed method includes diffusion-based VI, hybrid HMC with learned proposals, and a modular UQ layer. The experiment plan covers benchmarking, evaluation, integration, large-scale deployment, and ablation studies.",
