    "Summary": "The proposal aims to enhance machine learning robustness under distribution shifts by integrating causal representation learning and meta-learning. It hypothesizes that disentangling causal features and fine-tuning them via meta-learning will improve generalization. The method involves causal feature disentanglement, meta-learning for adaptation, and a unified architecture with attention mechanisms. The experiment plan includes synthetic benchmarks, domain generalization tests, real-world deployment, scalability checks, and human-in-the-loop evaluations.",
