    "Summary": "The proposal aims to optimize distributed training infrastructure for large-scale AI models through a hardware-software co-design approach, targeting communication inefficiencies, memory fragmentation, and lack of hardware-aware software libraries. The method includes a hardware-aware communication optimizer, a chunked memory allocator, and compiler-based kernel fusion for heterogeneous hardware. The experiment plan is comprehensive, covering benchmarking, evaluation, validation, and ablation studies.",
