    "Summary": "The proposal introduces Adaptive Reset Optimization (ARO), a framework for gradient-based optimization in non-stationary settings. ARO integrates change-point detection and dynamic reset mechanisms to improve convergence and robustness in tasks like continual learning and adversarial training.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Addresses a relevant and timely problem in deep learning (non-stationary objectives).",
        "Proposes a novel combination of change-point detection and dynamic reset mechanisms.",
        "Comprehensive experimental plan covering synthetic benchmarks, continual learning, adversarial robustness, and large-scale pretraining."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks depth in justifying the connection between non-stationarity detection and specific reset mechanisms.",
        "Feasibility of integrating change-point detection into optimization loops is questionable.",
        "Overly optimistic about computational overhead and scalability.",
        "Experimental plan lacks detail on fair baseline implementation and ablation studies."

    "Questions": [
        "How will the computational overhead of change-point detection be managed in large-scale settings?",
        "What specific statistical tests will be used for non-stationarity detection, and how will their thresholds be learned?",
        "How will the baselines (e.g., AdaHessian) be tuned to ensure fair comparison?",
        "What are the expected trade-offs between detection accuracy and computational cost?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "Scalability of change-point detection in large-scale models.",
        "Sensitivity to hyperparameters (detection threshold, reset frequency).",
        "Potential overfitting of reset mechanisms to specific tasks."
