    "Summary": "The proposal aims to improve machine learning robustness under distribution shifts by combining latent disentanglement, self-supervised learning, and distributionally robust optimization. It hypothesizes that disentangling invariant and spurious features will lead to better generalization. The method includes a three-part framework: latent disentanglement via self-supervision, DRO with a shift-aware regularizer, and test-time adaptation. Experiments are planned on synthetic benchmarks, vision tasks, language tasks, efficiency analysis, and real-world deployment.",
