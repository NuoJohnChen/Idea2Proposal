Overall Quality: 6
Argumentative Cohesion: 7
Intellectual Depth: 8
Execution Credibility: 5
Scientific Rigor: 6
Decision: Reject
Weaknesses: Lacks detailed technical specifics in the proposed method, particularly for differentiable causal learning., Feasibility of execution is uncertain due to potential scalability and computational challenges., Experimental plan lacks explicit discussion of failure modes and robustness checks., Limited discussion on handling noisy or unknown causal structures in real-world data.
