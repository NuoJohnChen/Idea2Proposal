    "Summary": "The proposal seeks to develop a theoretical framework for adaptive learning dynamics in non-convex optimization, focusing on the implicit bias of adaptive methods toward flatter minima. It combines continuous-time approximations, geometric analysis, and generalization bounds to explain the empirical success of methods like Adam and RMSprop.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement.",
        "Ambitious and potentially impactful hypothesis.",
        "Comprehensive proposed method combining multiple theoretical approaches.",
        "Detailed step-by-step experiment plan."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Feasibility concerns, especially in scaling to large models.",
        "Lack of discussion on potential pitfalls or alternative hypotheses.",
        "Overly ambitious given the current state of theory in this area.",
        "Limited discussion on how to handle the coupling between gradient estimates and adaptive learning rates."

        "How will the framework be validated against alternative hypotheses?",
        "What are the computational costs associated with scaling to large models?"

    "Limitations": [
        "Theoretical derivations may be overly complex and difficult to validate empirically.",
        "Scaling to large models may require significant computational resources.",
        "The framework may not fully capture the nuances of adaptive methods in practice."
