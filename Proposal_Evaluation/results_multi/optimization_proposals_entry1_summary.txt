Weaknesses: Feasibility concerns regarding the computational overhead of the Bayesian bandit model., Lack of detail on how non-stationarity detection will be validated in practice., Scalability to very large models (e.g., 10B parameters) is not convincingly demonstrated., Potential risk of overfitting the method to specific non-stationary scenarios.
