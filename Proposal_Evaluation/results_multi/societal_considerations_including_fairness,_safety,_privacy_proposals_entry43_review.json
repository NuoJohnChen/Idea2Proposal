    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a dynamic trade-off optimization framework to jointly address fairness, safety, and privacy in AI systems. It combines unified metric design, adaptive constraint enforcement, and human-in-the-loop auditing, with a detailed experiment plan including benchmarking, validation, real-world deployment, and longitudinal assessment.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Addresses a critical and timely issue in AI systems.",
        "Compelling hypothesis on the interdependence of fairness, safety, and privacy.",
        "Ambitious and comprehensive proposed method.",
        "Detailed and rigorous experiment plan."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Feasibility concerns due to the ambitious integration of diverse techniques.",
        "Lack of detailed discussion on potential technical barriers and risk mitigation.",
        "Human-in-the-loop component may introduce subjectivity and scalability issues."
