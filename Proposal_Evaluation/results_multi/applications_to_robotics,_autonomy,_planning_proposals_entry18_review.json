    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a robust autonomous navigation and planning system by integrating hierarchical world models with uncertainty-aware learning. It addresses the challenge of long-horizon planning in dynamic, unstructured environments through a combination of symbolic planning, Bayesian neural networks, and Monte Carlo Tree Search. The experimental plan includes validation of uncertainty estimation, benchmarking hierarchical planning, sim-to-real transfer, robustness testing, and ablation studies.",
