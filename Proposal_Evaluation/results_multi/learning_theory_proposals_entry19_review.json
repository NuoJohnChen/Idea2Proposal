    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a unified theoretical framework for adaptive synaptic plasticity by integrating local Hebbian updates, global neuromodulatory signals, and inhibitory feedback loops. It addresses the stability-plasticity dilemma in both biological and artificial neural networks, with validation through theoretical analysis, biological simulations, and machine learning benchmarks.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement highlighting gaps in current models.",
        "Ambitious hypothesis aiming to bridge biological plausibility with artificial neural network efficiency.",
        "Theoretically grounded proposed method, leveraging and extending existing work.",
        "Thorough experiment plan covering theoretical, biological, and machine learning validations.",
        "High scientific rigor with planned comparisons to strong baselines and ablation studies."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Feasibility of integrating diverse components into a unified framework is not thoroughly discussed.",
        "Lacks detailed risk mitigation strategies for potential technical hurdles.",
        "Scalability to very large neural networks is not fully explored.",

        "What are the computational overheads of implementing the proposed plasticity rules in large-scale artificial networks?",
        "How will the framework be validated against real biological data beyond simulations?",
        "What are the potential failure modes of the proposed framework, and how will they be mitigated?"

    "Limitations": [
        "Integration of diverse components may introduce unforeseen complexities.",
        "Biological validation relies heavily on simulations, which may not fully capture real-world variability.",
        "Scalability to very large neural networks is untested.",
        "Robustness under noisy and delayed feedback conditions is not fully validated."
