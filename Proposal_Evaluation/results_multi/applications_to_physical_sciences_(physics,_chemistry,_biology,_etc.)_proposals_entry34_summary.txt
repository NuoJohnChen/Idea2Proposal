Weaknesses: Lacks explicit discussion of potential technical challenges and risks, such as computational overhead of the gating network or scalability of the attention mechanism., Validation plan could be strengthened with more explicit discussion of ablation studies to isolate component contributions., Feasibility concerns about the gating network and scalability of the hybrid approach., Incremental nature of combining existing techniques may limit intellectual depth.
