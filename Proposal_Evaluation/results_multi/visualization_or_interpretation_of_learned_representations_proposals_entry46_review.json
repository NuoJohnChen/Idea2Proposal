    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a systematic framework for interpreting neural network representations by decomposing interpretability into compositionality, disentanglement, and robustness. It combines dynamic Concept Activation Vectors (dCAVs), generative disentanglement via diffusion models, and a stability-aware interpretation loss. The experiment plan includes benchmark evaluations, disentanglement validation, compositionality testing, robustness checks, and downstream task transfer.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement.",
        "Ambitious hypothesis with a novel decomposition of interpretability.",
        "Innovative method integrating multiple advanced techniques.",
        "Detailed and comprehensive experiment plan."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Limited discussion on potential technical challenges and risks.",
        "Scalability to large models and real-world datasets is not thoroughly addressed.",
        "Human evaluations via Mechanical Turk may introduce variability and bias."
