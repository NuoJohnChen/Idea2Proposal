    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a biologically plausible dynamic attention model by integrating predictive coding, dopaminergic gating, and saliency-based competition. It proposes a hybrid architecture combining spiking neural networks and rate-based networks, with validation against neural and behavioral data.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement",
        "Ambitious hypothesis integrating multiple biological mechanisms",
        "Detailed proposed method with neural alignment and cognitive benchmarking",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan covering validation, adaptability, disruption, scaling, and clinical translation"
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Feasibility of integrating diverse biological mechanisms into a single model is questionable",
        "Lacks detailed discussion on potential technical challenges (e.g., computational complexity of SNNs, integration of fMRI and single-neuron data)",
        "Limited discussion on baseline comparisons or alternative approaches",
        "Scientific rigor could be improved with more detailed ablation studies or stress tests"
