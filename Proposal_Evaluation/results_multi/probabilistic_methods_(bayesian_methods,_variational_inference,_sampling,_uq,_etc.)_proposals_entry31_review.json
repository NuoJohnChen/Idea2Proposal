    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a scalable and robust probabilistic inference framework that bridges Bayesian methods with deep learning. It addresses the limitations of current methods in computational inefficiency and scalability by combining expressive variational inference, hybrid SG-MCMC, and adaptive uncertainty calibration. The experiment plan includes benchmarks, scalability testing, hybrid inference validation, and ablation studies.",
