Weaknesses: Lacks detailed discussion on potential technical challenges, such as computational complexity or feasibility of fitting the model to EEG/MEG data., Baseline comparisons are not explicitly detailed., Clinical relevance testing may dilute the focus of the study., Feasibility of integrating complex biological mechanisms into a computational model is questionable., Experimental plan may be overly ambitious given the technical challenges.
