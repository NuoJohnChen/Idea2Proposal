    "Summary": "The proposal introduces Adaptive Model-Based Priors (AMBP), a novel framework for combining model-free and model-based RL by dynamically adjusting reliance on model-based priors based on uncertainty. The method includes uncertainty-calibrated dynamics models, adaptive policy optimization, and task-aware prior distillation. The experiment plan covers validation, benchmarking, generalization, transfer learning, and real-world deployment.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement.",
        "Compelling hypothesis with a novel approach to hybrid RL.",
        "Technically sound method leveraging ensemble models and adaptive policy optimization.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan with strong baselines and validation tests."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Limited discussion on computational overhead and scalability of ensemble models.",
        "Lack of detailed metrics for evaluating robustness of adaptive weighting.",
        "Insufficient exploration of real-world deployment challenges (e.g., sim-to-real transfer)."

        "How will the method handle cases where model uncertainty is high across most states?"

    "Limitations": [
        "Potential high computational cost due to ensemble models, which may limit real-time applications.",
        "Scalability to very high-dimensional state spaces is not thoroughly addressed.",
        "Dependence on accurate uncertainty estimation, which may be difficult in practice, especially in noisy or non-stationary environments.",
        "Risk of overfitting in the ensemble models if not properly regularized."
