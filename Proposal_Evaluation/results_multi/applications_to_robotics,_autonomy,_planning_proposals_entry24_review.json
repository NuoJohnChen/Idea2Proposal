    "Summary": "The proposal aims to integrate hierarchical symbolic planning with reinforcement learning (RL) for robust robotic autonomy in dynamic environments. It introduces a three-tiered architecture with a symbolic planner, neural latent interface, and RL policy, enabling bidirectional communication. The experiment plan includes validation, benchmarking, real-world deployment, ablation studies, and scalability testing.",
