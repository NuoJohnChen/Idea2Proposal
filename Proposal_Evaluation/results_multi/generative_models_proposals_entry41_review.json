    "Summary": "The proposal aims to bridge the gap between quality and interpretability in generative models by combining disentangled latent diffusion with energy-based steering. It targets high-fidelity, controllable synthesis with improved compositional generalization and efficiency.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement.",
        "Ambitious and original hypothesis combining diffusion models and energy-based models.",
        "Detailed and comprehensive experiment plan.",
        "Strong focus on both theoretical and practical validation."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Execution risks due to the complexity of integrating disparate model types.",
        "Lack of detailed discussion on potential technical challenges and mitigation strategies.",
        "Narrative could be tighter in connecting the problem to the proposed solution."
