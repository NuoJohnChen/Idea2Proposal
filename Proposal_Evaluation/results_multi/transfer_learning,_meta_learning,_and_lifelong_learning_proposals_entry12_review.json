    "Summary": "Proposes a unified framework integrating transfer, meta, and lifelong learning to improve AI adaptability. Identifies gaps in current approaches and suggests a hybrid architecture with transfer backbones, meta-adapters, and memory mechanisms. Experiments cover cross-domain transfer, sequential learning, scalability, and real-world deployment.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement highlighting gaps in AI adaptability.",
        "Ambitious integration of three learning paradigms with novel synergy hypothesis.",
        "Comprehensive experimental plan with diverse benchmarks and metrics."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "High technical risk in merging complex paradigms may lead to unstable performance.",
        "Limited discussion of computational costs or failure modes in real-world scaling.",
        "Overly optimistic about seamless integration without addressing potential conflicts."

        "What are the computational limits of scaling to 100+ tasks in dynamic environments?",
        "What fallback strategies exist if core components underperform?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "High computational overhead from multi-component integration.",
