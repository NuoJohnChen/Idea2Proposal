Weaknesses: Dataset quality concerns (e.g., missing Tc values, inconsistent structural descriptors)., Limited discussion on model interpretability for domain scientists., Scalability of GNNs to screen ~100,000 hypothetical compounds is unproven., Experimental validation relies heavily on external collaboration, introducing delays.
