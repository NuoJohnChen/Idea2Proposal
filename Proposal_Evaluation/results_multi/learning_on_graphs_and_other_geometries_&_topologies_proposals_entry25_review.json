    "Summary": "The proposal aims to extend deep learning to non-Euclidean domains by integrating geometric and topological priors. It proposes a three-part framework with unified geometric operators, adaptive topology processing, and efficient multi-scale hierarchies. The experiment plan includes validation of geometric equivariance, evaluation of topological invariance, scalability testing, and comparisons to state-of-the-art methods.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement.",
        "Strong motivation with hypotheses grounded in recent literature.",
        "Detailed and credible proposed method.",
        "Thorough experiment plan with multiple validation steps and comparisons.",
        "High scientific rigor with planned ablation studies and hyperparameter sensitivity analyses."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks explicit discussion of potential technical challenges and risks.",
        "Dynamic graph rewiring and topological attention components could benefit from more detailed risk assessment."
