    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a hybrid framework combining adaptive variational inference, gradient-based sampling with neural surrogates, and uncertainty-aware neural architectures to bridge the gap between probabilistic methods and deep learning. It addresses scalability and accuracy challenges in current probabilistic methods for high-dimensional, non-linear models.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement.",
        "Strong motivation and hypothesis grounded in existing literature.",
        "Ambitious and intellectually deep proposal with potential for significant impact.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan covering synthetic and real-world datasets."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks detailed technical specifics on implementation (e.g., neural surrogates, probabilistic layers).",
        "Experiment plan could benefit from more detailed baseline comparisons and evaluation metrics.",
        "Potential computational overhead and scalability issues are not fully addressed."
