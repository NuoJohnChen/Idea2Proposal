    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a hybrid framework combining Bayesian methods and deep learning to address scalability and robustness challenges in probabilistic inference. It proposes three main components: expressive VI with normalizing flows, efficient stochastic gradient MCMC, and robust UQ. The experiment plan includes benchmarking, scalability testing, UQ evaluation, real-world applications, and theoretical analysis.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Addresses a significant gap in the field by bridging Bayesian methods and deep learning.",
        "Proposes a novel hybrid framework with three distinct components.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan covering benchmarking, scalability, UQ, and real-world applications.",
        "Strong motivation and problem statement."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks detailed discussion on potential technical challenges and risks.",
        "Execution plan needs more concrete details to ensure feasibility.",
        "Theoretical analysis is not deeply integrated into method development.",
        "Argumentative cohesion could be improved by better linking theoretical and empirical components."
