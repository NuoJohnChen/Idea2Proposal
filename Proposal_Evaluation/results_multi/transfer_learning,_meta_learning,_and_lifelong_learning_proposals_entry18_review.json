    "Summary": "The proposal aims to unify transfer learning, meta-learning, and lifelong learning into a single framework using task-conditioned plasticity. It integrates task-relation-aware meta-initialization, dynamic plasticity via sparse activation, and a lifelong memory module. The experiment plan includes benchmark scenarios, ablation studies, and real-world deployment.",
