Weaknesses: Transition from problem statement to proposed method could be more seamless., Novelty of the uncertainty-adaptive meta-planner could be more explicitly highlighted., Lacks detail on how key technical challenges (e.g., real-time optimization, hardware integration) will be addressed., Experimental plan could include more robust baselines and metrics., Feasibility concerns about real-time execution and computational overhead.
