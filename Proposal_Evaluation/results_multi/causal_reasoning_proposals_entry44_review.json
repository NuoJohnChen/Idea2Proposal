    "Summary": "The proposal aims to bridge the gap between correlation and causation in AI by developing structured latent variable models (SLVMs) that combine deep learning with causal graphical models. The method includes identifiable latent causal models, scalable inference with causal regularization, and counterfactual generation via latent interventions. The experiment plan covers synthetic, semi-synthetic, and real-world datasets, with validation against known biological pathways and expert-annotated counterfactual datasets.",
