    "Summary": "The proposal introduces dynamic latent manifolds to improve the trade-off between sample quality and diversity in generative models. It combines Riemannian flows, stochastic regularization, and diffusion priors in a novel framework, with extensive experimental validation planned across synthetic and real-world datasets.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Novel and theoretically grounded approach to a well-known problem in generative models.",
        "Strong integration of advanced techniques (Riemannian flows, stochastic regularization, diffusion priors).",
        "Comprehensive experimental plan with multiple benchmarks and ablation studies.",
        "Clear potential to bridge the gap between sample quality and diversity."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Feasibility concerns, especially in scaling to high-dimensional data and computational overhead.",
        "Limited discussion on potential failure modes and alternative hypotheses.",
        "Execution plan lacks detail on handling the complexity of dynamic manifolds in practice."

    "Questions": [

        "What are the potential failure modes of the metric predictor network?",
        "How will the stochastic regularization term be tuned to balance mode preservation and sample quality?"

    "Limitations": [
        "Computational overhead of dynamic manifolds may limit practical applicability.",
        "Potential instability in training due to the complexity of the combined framework.",
        "Limited discussion on how the model will handle extremely sparse modes in long-tail distributions."
