    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a unified framework for interpreting deep neural networks by combining feature visualization, concept activation vectors, and intervention-based causality. It seeks to visualize and quantify disentangled representations and relate them to model decisions, with experiments planned across vision and language models.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Addresses a critical and timely problem in deep learning interpretability.",
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement highlighting limitations of existing methods.",
        "Ambitious hypothesis combining multiple established techniques.",
        "Detailed proposed method leveraging StyleGAN and NMF.",
        "Comprehensive experimental plan with validation, quantification, and user study components."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Execution plan lacks depth in addressing potential technical challenges (e.g., scalability of StyleGAN, reliability of crowdsourced labeling).",
        "Reliance on human annotations may introduce bias or inconsistency.",
        "Validation plan could benefit from more rigorous baselines and ablation studies.",
        "Scalability of hybrid visualization approach is not adequately addressed.",
        "Limited discussion on computational resources required for large-scale experiments."
