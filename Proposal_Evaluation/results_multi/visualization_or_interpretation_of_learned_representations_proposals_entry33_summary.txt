Decision: Accept
Weaknesses: Execution plan lacks depth in addressing potential technical challenges (e.g., scalability of StyleGAN, reliability of crowdsourced labeling)., Reliance on human annotations may introduce bias or inconsistency., Validation plan could benefit from more rigorous baselines and ablation studies., Scalability of hybrid visualization approach is not adequately addressed., Limited discussion on computational resources required for large-scale experiments.
