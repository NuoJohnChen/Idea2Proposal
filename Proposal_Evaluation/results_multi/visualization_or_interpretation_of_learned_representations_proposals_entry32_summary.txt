Weaknesses: Computational challenges of scaling dynamic visualization and intervention methods to large models (e.g., BERT) are not fully addressed., Lack of detailed discussion on trade-offs between interpretability and model performance., Potential redundancy with existing disentanglement metrics (e.g., Mutual Information Gap)., Human validation studies may introduce subjectivity unless rigorously controlled.
