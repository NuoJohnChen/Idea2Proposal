    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop scalable and robust probabilistic inference methods by integrating adaptive variational families, efficient SG-MCMC, and uncertainty-aware deep architectures. It targets the limitations of current Bayesian methods in scalability and accuracy, particularly in high-dimensional settings like deep learning.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement.",
        "Ambitious and original hypothesis combining Bayesian methods and deep learning.",
        "Detailed proposed method with innovative components.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan covering synthetic and real-world data, scalability tests, and ablation studies."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Feasibility of scaling to large models like GPT-3 is questionable and lacks detailed justification.",
        "Limited discussion on computational resources, potential bottlenecks, and risk mitigation strategies.",
        "Potential high computational overhead from adaptive components."

    "Questions": [
        "What computational resources are required to scale the proposed methods to GPT-3 level models?",
        "How will the adaptive flow-based VI handle extremely high-dimensional posteriors?",
        "What are the potential failure modes of the adaptive thermostats in SG-MCMC, and how will they be mitigated?",
        "What are the fallback options if the adaptive components fail to converge?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "Scalability to extremely large models like GPT-3 is untested and may face significant computational challenges.",
        "The adaptive flow-based VI may struggle with very high-dimensional posteriors.",
        "The proposed methods may introduce additional hyperparameters that require careful tuning."
