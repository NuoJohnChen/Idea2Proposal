    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a unified representation learning framework that dynamically combines unsupervised, self-supervised, semi-supervised, and supervised paradigms. It leverages a shared latent space with adaptive weighting of learning objectives to address fragmentation in current methods. The method includes a multi-task loss formulation, adaptive latent space alignment, and an efficient training pipeline. The experiment plan covers benchmarking, ablation studies, cross-paradigm transfer, scalability, and real-world deployment.",
