    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a robust multi-agent planning framework by integrating learned latent-space dynamics models with hierarchical, decentralized planning. It addresses the limitations of current methods in balancing robustness and scalability, proposing a three-part framework involving uncertainty-aware latent dynamics, hierarchical MCTS, and online adaptation via meta-learning. The experiment plan includes validation in synthetic benchmarks, simulation, real-world robot fleet coordination, generalization evaluation, and safety analysis.",
