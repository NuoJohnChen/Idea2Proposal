    "Summary": "The proposal seeks to improve distributed deep learning scalability by developing a unified infrastructure that combines adaptive communication protocols and hardware-aware scheduling. It targets communication efficiency and hardware utilization, focusing on large-scale models (>1B parameters) and heterogeneous clusters. The method includes an adaptive communication layer, a hardware-aware scheduler, and a unified software stack. The experiment plan covers benchmarks, validation, scaling tests, real-world deployment, and ablation studies.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement with relevant literature citations.",
        "Ambitious hypothesis targeting multiplicative gains in efficiency.",
        "Detailed proposed method with three distinct components.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan, including ablation studies and real-world deployment."
