    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a hybrid optimization framework combining zeroth-order methods and evolutionary strategies to overcome limitations of gradient-based optimization. It includes a hybrid core, adaptive switching mechanism, and surrogate-assisted ES, with a comprehensive experiment plan covering synthetic benchmarks, black-box tasks, high-dimensional scaling, theoretical analysis, and real-world deployment.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement highlighting limitations of current methods.",
        "Ambitious hypothesis proposing synergy between local and global optimization.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan covering diverse scenarios.",
        "Innovative adaptive switching mechanism using RL."
