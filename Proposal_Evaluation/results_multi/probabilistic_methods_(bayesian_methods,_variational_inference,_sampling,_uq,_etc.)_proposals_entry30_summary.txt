Weaknesses: Lacks clear discussion of potential technical challenges and risks, especially in scaling to large models., Feasibility of integrating adaptive VI and bias-corrected MCMC is unclear, with no detailed implementation plan., Experiment plan does not explicitly address computational resource requirements or potential bottlenecks., Validation could benefit from more rigorous baselines and stress tests.
