    "Summary": "The proposal aims to address the challenge of robust and generalizable machine learning under distribution shifts by combining self-supervised learning with causal inference. It proposes a three-pronged approach involving self-supervised disentanglement, causal regularization, and dynamic adaptation, with a detailed experiment plan covering synthetic benchmarks, domain generalization tasks, large-scale OOD evaluation, ablation studies, and real-world deployment.",
