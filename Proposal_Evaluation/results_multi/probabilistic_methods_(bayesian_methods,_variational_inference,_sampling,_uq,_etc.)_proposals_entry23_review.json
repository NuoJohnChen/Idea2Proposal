    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a hybrid probabilistic inference framework combining VI and MCMC to improve scalability and accuracy in Bayesian deep learning. It includes adaptive posterior approximation, scalable uncertainty quantification, and calibration-aware objectives, with experiments planned on synthetic data, high-dimensional tasks, and robustness tests.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement highlighting limitations of current methods.",
        "Innovative hypothesis proposing a dynamic hybrid approach.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan covering diverse tasks and metrics."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lack of detailed technical specifics (e.g., dynamic switching mechanism).",
        "Overly optimistic computational overhead assumptions.",
        "Vague baseline comparisons and validation depth."

        "What are the computational trade-offs of the hybrid framework compared to standalone methods?",
        "Which state-of-the-art baselines will be used, and how will fairness in comparison be ensured?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "High computational overhead risk due to hybrid nature.",
