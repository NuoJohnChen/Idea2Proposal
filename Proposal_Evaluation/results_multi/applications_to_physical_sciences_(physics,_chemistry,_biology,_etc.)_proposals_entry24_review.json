    "Summary": "The proposal aims to accelerate the discovery of quantum materials using physics-informed graph neural networks (GNNs) and active learning. It addresses the limitations of traditional methods and existing ML approaches by integrating physical constraints and Bayesian optimization into a scalable, data-efficient framework.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement highlighting the limitations of traditional methods and existing ML approaches.",
        "Plausible hypothesis grounded in recent advances in geometric deep learning.",
        "Comprehensive experimental plan with a focus on benchmarking, validation, and community deployment."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Narrative is somewhat disjointed, with a less-than-smooth transition from problem statement to proposed method.",
        "Core insight feels incremental rather than groundbreaking, lacking sufficient differentiation from existing work.",
        "Lacks detail on how key challenges (e.g., data scarcity, model interpretability) will be addressed.",
        "Validation plan could be more rigorous, with clearer outlines for experimental validation and discussion of potential failure modes."

    "Questions": [
        "How exactly will the active learning loop be implemented to address data scarcity?",
        "What specific measures will be taken to ensure the model's interpretability?",
        "How will the model's predictions be validated against experimental data?",
        "What are the potential failure modes or limitations of the GNN approach, and how will they be mitigated?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "Potential challenges in scaling the GNN to very large chemical spaces.",
        "Reliance on DFT calculations for training data, which may introduce biases or inaccuracies.",
        "Limited discussion of how the model will handle materials with complex quantum interactions."
