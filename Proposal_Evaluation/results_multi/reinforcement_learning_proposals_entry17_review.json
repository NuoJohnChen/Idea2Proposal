    "Summary": "The proposal introduces Adaptive Prior RL (APRL), a framework to improve sample efficiency in reinforcement learning by dynamically integrating model-based priors with online exploration. It addresses limitations of current model-free and model-based RL methods, proposing uncertainty-aware model priors and task-driven adaptation. The experiment plan includes validation of uncertainty estimation, comparison with baselines, task adaptation evaluation, long-horizon planning, and real-world robot validation.",
