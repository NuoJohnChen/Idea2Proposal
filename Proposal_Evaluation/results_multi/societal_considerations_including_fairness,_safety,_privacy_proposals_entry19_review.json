    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a unified framework for societal alignment in AI systems, addressing fairness, safety, and privacy through dynamic metrics, safety-auditing mechanisms, and context-aware privacy techniques. The experiment plan includes benchmarking, testing interventions, evaluating trade-offs, deploying the framework, and longitudinal analysis.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Comprehensive problem statement highlighting gaps in current approaches.",
        "Strong motivation with clear references to prior work.",
        "Ambitious and original hypothesis about the interdependence of fairness, safety, and privacy.",
        "Detailed experiment plan with multiple stages of validation."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks concrete details on multi-objective optimization implementation.",
        "Feasibility challenges in some experiment steps (e.g., red-teaming language models).",
        "Trade-offs quantification could be more explicitly detailed.",
        "Reliance on existing methodologies without groundbreaking innovations.",
        "Feasibility of seamlessly integrating all three dimensions remains a challenge."
