    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a unified framework for interpreting and disentangling learned features in deep neural networks, combining concept-based representation disentanglement, dynamic visualization via latent interventions, and cross-architecture benchmarking. The experiment plan includes quantifying feature interpretability, training concept bottleneck models, validating interventions through user studies, benchmarking scalability, and conducting ablation studies.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Addresses a critical and timely problem in deep learning: interpretability of neural representations.",
        "Builds on a solid foundation of prior work, including Network Dissection, concept activation vectors, and latent space interventions.",
        "Detailed and well-structured experiment plan with quantifiable metrics and user studies.",
        "High intellectual depth and ambition, proposing a unified framework for interpretability."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Limited discussion on computational scalability, especially for large-scale models like CLIP, which may require significant resources.",
        "User studies may introduce biases based on participant selection and interpretation, with no clear mitigation strategy outlined.",
        "The framework's generalizability across diverse architectures and tasks is not thoroughly explored."
