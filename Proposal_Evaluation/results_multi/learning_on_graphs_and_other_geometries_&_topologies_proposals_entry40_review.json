    "Summary": "The proposal aims to advance geometric deep learning by unifying geometric priors with adaptive spectral filtering to address limitations in current GNNs. It introduces a three-part framework involving adaptive spectral graph convolutions, geometric regularization for manifolds, and dynamic topology learning. The experiment plan includes synthetic benchmarking, molecular property prediction, 3D shape analysis, dynamic graph forecasting, and theoretical analysis.",
