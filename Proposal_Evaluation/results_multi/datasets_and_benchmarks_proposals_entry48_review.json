    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a dynamic, multi-dimensional benchmarking framework for AI evaluation, addressing limitations in current benchmarks such as static tasks, lack of diversity, and bias. It combines dynamic task generation, multi-dimensional evaluation, and bias-aware dataset curation to create a more rigorous and scalable evaluation paradigm.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement with well-cited literature.",
        "Ambitious and comprehensive proposed method.",
        "Detailed experiment plan including a longitudinal study.",
        "Strong focus on bias and fairness, integrating existing tools like REVISE."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks specific technical details on dynamic task generation and multi-dimensional evaluation.",
        "Intellectual depth is somewhat limited as it builds on existing work without a fundamentally new paradigm.",
        "Execution credibility is uncertain due to lack of detail in implementation.",
        "Scientific rigor could be enhanced with more detailed ablation studies and stronger baselines."

    "Limitations": [
        "Potential challenges in scaling the dynamic task generation platform.",
        "Uncertainty in the real-world applicability of the proposed framework.",
        "Risk of benchmark saturation despite dynamic adaptation."
