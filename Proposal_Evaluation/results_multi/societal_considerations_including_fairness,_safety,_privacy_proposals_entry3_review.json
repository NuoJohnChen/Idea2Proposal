    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a framework for jointly optimizing fairness, safety, and privacy in AI systems through a compositional approach combining multi-objective loss functions, formal verification, and adaptive deployment. It addresses gaps in current siloed methods and includes a detailed experimental plan covering benchmarking, joint optimization, formal verification, real-world deployment, and longitudinal impact studies.",
