    "Summary": "The proposal addresses scalability and robustness challenges in probabilistic inference by combining Bayesian methods with deep learning. It proposes three main innovations: flexible VI with normalizing flows, gradient-based MCMC with learned proposals, and a unified UQ framework. The experiment plan includes benchmarking on synthetic and real-world data, testing on Bayesian neural networks, and evaluating in safety-critical applications.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement.",
        "Ambitious hypothesis with three distinct but complementary innovations.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan covering synthetic and real-world data.",
        "Rigorous validation metrics and comparisons to state-of-the-art baselines."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks detailed discussion of potential technical challenges (e.g., computational cost of normalizing flows, stability of learned proposals).",
        "Limited critical analysis of feasibility and risks.",
        "Baseline comparisons could be more explicitly discussed."
