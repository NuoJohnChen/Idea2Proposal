    "Summary": "The proposal aims to redesign AI benchmarks and datasets to address limitations like static evaluation, data bias, and scalability gaps. It introduces dynamic task generation, bias audits, and scalable evaluation protocols, with a detailed experiment plan to validate these improvements.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement with strong literature support.",
        "Strong motivation and hypothesis addressing critical gaps in AI evaluation.",
        "Comprehensive proposed method with three innovative components.",
        "Detailed and systematic experiment plan covering multiple validation aspects."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks depth in discussing technical challenges (e.g., computational costs, scalability of human-in-the-loop validation).",
        "Execution details (e.g., toolkit implementation, resource requirements) are underdeveloped.",
        "Validation plan could explicitly discuss baselines, ablation studies, and failure modes."
