    "Summary": "The proposal seeks to unify empirical and theoretical understanding of deep neural networks by analyzing optimization trajectories and architectural biases. It aims to develop trajectory-dependent complexity measures, model architectural biases as constraints, and derive data-dependent generalization bounds. The experiment plan includes validation, quantification, benchmarking, and real-world applications.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement.",
        "Ambitious hypothesis combining optimization dynamics and architectural biases.",
