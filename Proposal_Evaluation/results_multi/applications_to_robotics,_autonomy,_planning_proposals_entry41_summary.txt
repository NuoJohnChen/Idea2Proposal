Decision: Accept
Weaknesses: Lack of discussion on computational resources and potential bottlenecks., Feasibility concerns about integrating complex components (VAE, MCTS, meta-learning) seamlessly., Scalability of MCTS in real-world settings is not adequately addressed., Baseline comparisons could be more explicitly justified to ensure scientific rigor.
