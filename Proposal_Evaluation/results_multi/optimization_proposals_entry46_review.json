    "Summary": "The proposal introduces an adaptive gradient memory framework to optimize non-stationary objectives, addressing limitations in current gradient-based methods. It includes a three-part framework for gradient non-stationarity detection, dynamic optimization policy, and memory-efficient implementation, validated through synthetic benchmarks, meta-learning, adversarial training, and scalability analysis.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement highlighting limitations of current methods.",
        "Compelling hypothesis on explicit modeling of gradient non-stationarity.",
        "Detailed three-part framework for adaptive gradient optimization.",
        "Thorough experiment plan covering diverse validation scenarios.",
        "Strong scientific rigor with planned ablation studies."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks discussion on challenges in training the policy network end-to-end.",
        "Computational overhead of proposed mechanisms not fully addressed.",
        "Execution credibility could be improved with more detailed risk mitigation strategies."

    "Limitations": [
        "Potential high computational cost due to additional gradient history and policy network.",
