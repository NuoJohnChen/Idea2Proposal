{
    "Summary": "The proposal critiques current AI benchmarks for prioritizing scale over quality, diversity, and explainability, and proposes a framework for creating high-quality, diverse, and explainable datasets. It includes dynamic filtering pipelines, diversity-aware sampling, and explainability-integrated evaluation, with a step-by-step experiment plan to validate the approach.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Timely and relevant problem statement with strong citations to recent literature.",
        "Compelling hypothesis that smaller, high-quality datasets can outperform larger, noisier ones.",
        "Innovative components like dynamic filtering pipelines and diversity-aware sampling.",
        "Structured and detailed experiment plan with clear milestones."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks specificity in some execution details, such as exact mechanisms for dynamic filtering.",
        "Longitudinal real-world testing may be logistically challenging and lacks detail on implementation.",
        "Potential risks in scalability and generalizability of the proposed methods are not fully addressed."

        "What specific measures will be taken to ensure that synthetic edge cases do not introduce new biases?"

    "Limitations": [
        "Potential scalability issues with human-in-the-loop verification.",
        "Generalizability of findings to other domains beyond the selected benchmarks.",
        "Dependence on professional translation for low-resource languages may limit diversity.",
        "Longitudinal real-world testing may be resource-intensive and difficult to control."
