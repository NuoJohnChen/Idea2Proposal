    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a co-designed infrastructure for efficient distributed training of large-scale AI models, focusing on adaptive communication scheduling, unified memory management, and hardware-aware parallelism. It aims to address inefficiencies in current frameworks like PyTorch DDP and FSDP, with a detailed experiment plan to validate the approach.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement with well-articulated gaps in current frameworks.",
        "Strong motivation backed by prior work and clear hypotheses.",
        "Detailed proposed method that builds on existing techniques.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan with robust validation strategies."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks depth in addressing potential technical challenges and risks.",
        "Could benefit from more critical analyses like ablation studies.",
        "Intellectual depth and ambition could be higher."
