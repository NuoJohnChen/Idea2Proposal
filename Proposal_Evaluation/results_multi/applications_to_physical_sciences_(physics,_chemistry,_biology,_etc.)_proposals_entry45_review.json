    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a hybrid neural operator architecture combining graph-based representations (GNNs) and spectral methods (FNOs) with attention mechanisms to accelerate multiscale physical system simulations. It aims to improve adaptivity, generalization, and interpretability over existing methods like FEA and PINNs through physics-guided training and uncertainty quantification. The experiment plan covers validation on canonical PDEs, multiscale materials modeling, generalization tests, real-world deployment, and computational efficiency benchmarks.",
