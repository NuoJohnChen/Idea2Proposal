    "Summary": "The proposal introduces Adaptive Model-Based Priors (AMBP), a novel framework for combining model-free and model-based RL by dynamically weighting the trust in model-based rollouts based on uncertainty estimates. The method aims to improve sample efficiency and robustness in RL tasks. The proposal includes a clear problem statement, plausible hypothesis, detailed method with uncertainty-aware dynamics models, trust-gated policy optimization, and stabilized model rollouts, and a comprehensive experiment plan.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and compelling problem statement highlighting limitations of current hybrid RL methods.",
        "Novel hypothesis proposing dynamic trust in model-based rollouts based on uncertainty.",
        "Detailed proposed method with uncertainty-aware dynamics models, trust-gated policy optimization, and stabilized model rollouts.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan covering validation, benchmarking, adaptive gating, generalization, and scalability."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks detailed discussion of computational overhead and training complexity for the ensemble of probabilistic neural networks and trust gate.",
        "Experiment plan does not address partial observability or non-stationary dynamics, limiting broader applicability.",
        "No clear baseline comparison against other uncertainty-aware methods (e.g., Bayesian RL).",
        "Potential risks and pitfalls of the proposed method are not thoroughly explored."
