    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a universal geometric deep learning framework using equivariant architectures to unify learning across graphs and other geometries. It addresses limitations of current GNNs by integrating tools from differential geometry, algebraic topology, and group theory. The method consists of three components: equivariant message passing on cell complexes, geometry-aware latent spaces, and topological regularization. Experiments include validation on synthetic tasks, real-world benchmarks, topological generalization tests, ablation studies, and large-scale applications.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-motivated problem statement with identified gaps in current GNNs",
