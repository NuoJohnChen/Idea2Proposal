Overall Quality: 7
Argumentative Cohesion: 7
Intellectual Depth: 8
Execution Credibility: 6
Scientific Rigor: 6
Decision: Accept
Weaknesses: Lacks depth in discussing potential technical challenges (e.g., computational complexity, overfitting risk)., Validation plan could benefit from more critical analyses (e.g., failure mode exploration, robustness to adversarial inputs)., Limited discussion on how to ensure the joint optimization converges or scales efficiently.
