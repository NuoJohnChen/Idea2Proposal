    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a dynamic attention model inspired by neural mechanisms to bridge computational models and cognitive neuroscience. It hypothesizes that input-dependent attentional reweighting will outperform static models and align better with neural data. The method involves designing a biologically plausible attention mechanism, aligning it with neural data via latent variables, and integrating these into a unified architecture. The experiment plan includes synthetic task validation, neural data alignment, behavioral benchmarking, ablations, and scalability tests.",
