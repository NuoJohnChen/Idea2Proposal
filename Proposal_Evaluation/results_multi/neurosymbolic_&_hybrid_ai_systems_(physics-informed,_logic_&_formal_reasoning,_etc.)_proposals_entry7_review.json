    "Summary": "The proposal aims to integrate physics-informed learning with formal reasoning in neurosymbolic AI systems, addressing the limitations of purely neural or symbolic approaches. It proposes dynamic symbolic grounding as a solution, with a focus on unified representation learning, physics-informed symbolic priors, and dynamic rule induction. The experiment plan includes benchmarking, physics-constrained learning, automated theorem proving, real-world deployment, and scalability analysis.",
