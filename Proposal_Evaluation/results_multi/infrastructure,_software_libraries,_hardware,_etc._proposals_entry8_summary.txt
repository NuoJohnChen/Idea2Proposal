Overall Quality: 6
Argumentative Cohesion: 8
Intellectual Depth: 5
Execution Credibility: 6
Scientific Rigor: 5
Decision: Accept
Weaknesses: Incremental contribution; builds on existing work without introducing a fundamentally new paradigm., Execution credibility is moderate; scalability trade-offs and hardware compatibility challenges are not deeply explored., Scientific rigor could be improved with more critical validation (e.g., ablation studies, stress testing).
