    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a unified framework for visualizing and interpreting learned representations in deep neural networks (DNNs) by combining concept activation vectors (CAVs) with dynamic graph-based feature decomposition. The approach includes hierarchical concept discovery, task-driven attribution, and an interactive visualization tool. The experiment plan covers validation of concept discovery, hierarchical alignment, task relevance, human studies, and scaling to language models.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Addresses a significant and timely problem in AI interpretability.",
        "Novel combination of CAVs, contrastive learning, and graph-based decomposition.",
        "Comprehensive experimental plan with multiple validation steps.",
        "Proposes an interactive visualization tool for practical use."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Feasibility of integrating hierarchical concept discovery with task-driven attribution is unclear.",
        "Lacks quantitative metrics for validating hierarchical alignment.",
        "Scaling to language models (e.g., BERT) is not thoroughly addressed.",
        "Human studies lack clear success metrics."
