    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a unified representation learning framework across vision, audio, and language modalities using a transformer-based backbone with modality-specific tokenizers, lightweight adapters, and cross-modal contrastive learning. The goal is to achieve superior performance by leveraging cross-modal correlations and inductive biases.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Ambitious and intellectually deep hypothesis.",
        "Well-articulated problem statement highlighting fragmentation in current approaches.",
        "Theoretical soundness of the proposed method.",
        "Detailed and comprehensive experiment plan."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Feasibility concerns due to the complexity of harmonizing diverse modalities.",
        "Overly optimistic scope of experiments.",
        "Lacks detailed discussion on potential technical challenges and risks.",
        "Insufficient grounding in execution credibility and scientific rigor."

    "Questions": [
        "How will the proposed method handle extreme variations in input lengths across modalities (e.g., long audio vs. short text)?",
        "What are the specific technical challenges anticipated in aligning representations across such diverse modalities?",
        "How will the method ensure that modality-specific features are not lost in the shared latent space?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "Potential difficulty in achieving true modality-agnosticism without sacrificing performance in individual modalities.",
        "High computational cost and resource requirements for training and evaluation.",
        "Risk of overfitting in the shared latent space due to the complexity of cross-modal alignment."
