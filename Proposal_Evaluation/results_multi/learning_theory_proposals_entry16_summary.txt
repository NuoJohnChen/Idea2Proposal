Decision: Accept
Weaknesses: Lack of detailed discussion on potential technical challenges (e.g., complexity of SDE derivation, computational costs of Hessian spectra tracking)., Execution credibility could be improved with more risk mitigation strategies., Limited discussion on how to handle cases where the SDE approximation might fail., Scalability of experiments, especially with Transformers, could be challenging.
