    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a dynamic attention model using oscillatory gating mechanisms in spiking neural networks (SNNs) to bridge computational models and cognitive neuroscience. It addresses gaps in current attention models, proposes a novel oscillatory gating mechanism, and outlines a comprehensive validation plan including synthetic tasks, neural alignment, naturalistic tasks, ablation studies, and clinical benchmarks.",
