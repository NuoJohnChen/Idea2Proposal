Overall Quality: 7
Argumentative Cohesion: 7
Intellectual Depth: 8
Execution Credibility: 6
Scientific Rigor: 6
Decision: Accept
Weaknesses: Feasibility concerns due to the broad scope (three model families)., Lacks detailed discussion of computational overhead and training stability risks., Validation plan does not clearly test the universality of adaptive dynamics across models., Limited exploration of potential failure modes or limitations of adaptive mechanisms.
