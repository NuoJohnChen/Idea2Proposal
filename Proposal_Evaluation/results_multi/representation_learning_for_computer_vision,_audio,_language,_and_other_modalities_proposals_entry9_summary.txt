Weaknesses: Feasibility concerns around scaling to 10B parameters and dynamic fusion across diverse modalities., Lack of detailed discussion on computational resources and potential training bottlenecks., Potential risks in achieving zero-shot transfer to novel modalities like medical imaging and tactile data., Overly optimistic assumptions about the success of dynamic fusion layers and modality dropout.
