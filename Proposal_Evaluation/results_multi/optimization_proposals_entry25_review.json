    "Summary": "The proposal introduces AdaSparse, a novel adaptive gradient method designed to handle non-stationary and sparse gradient scenarios in optimization. It combines hierarchical learning rate adaptation, sparsity-aware gradient buffering, and a Bayesian exploration-exploitation tradeoff. The experiment plan includes synthetic benchmarks, deep learning tasks, and scaling tests, with thorough ablation studies.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement identifying gaps in existing methods.",
        "Innovative combination of hierarchical adaptation, sparsity-aware buffering, and Bayesian tuning.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan covering diverse scenarios and thorough ablation studies.",
        "Strong scientific rigor with well-designed validation and analysis."

    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks detailed discussion on computational overhead and practical deployment challenges.",
        "Feasibility of integrating all components into a single, efficient framework is uncertain.",
        "Intellectual depth, while significant, may not be paradigm-shifting."
