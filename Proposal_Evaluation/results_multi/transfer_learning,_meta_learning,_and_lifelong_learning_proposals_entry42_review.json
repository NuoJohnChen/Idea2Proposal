    "Summary": "The proposal aims to unify transfer, meta, and lifelong learning through a modular architecture with meta-learned plasticity rules. It addresses the limitations of current approaches and proposes a novel combination of dynamic representation sharing and task-adaptive plasticity. The method includes unified representation learning, meta-learning plasticity rules, and lifelong adaptation techniques. The experiment plan covers benchmarks, ablation studies, generalization tests, real-world deployment, and theoretical analysis.",
