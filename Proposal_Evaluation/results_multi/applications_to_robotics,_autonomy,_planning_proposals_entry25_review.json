    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a decentralized hierarchical RL framework with latent task abstraction for robust multi-agent planning under uncertainty. It combines latent space alignment, Bayesian neural networks, and distributed curriculum learning to address scalability and coordination challenges in dynamic, partially observable environments. The experiment plan includes validation in synthetic and simulated environments, scalability testing, and real-world deployment.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement highlighting limitations of existing methods.",
        "Innovative combination of latent task abstraction, Bayesian neural networks, and distributed curriculum learning.",
        "Detailed and comprehensive experiment plan with ablation studies.",
        "Potential for significant impact in real-world applications like search-and-rescue and warehouse automation."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks detailed discussion on computational overhead and real-time feasibility.",
        "Limited emphasis on robustness to adversarial conditions or sensor failures.",
        "Scalability claims to 50+ agents in complex environments are ambitious and not thoroughly justified.",
        "Integration of multiple advanced techniques may introduce unforeseen technical challenges."
