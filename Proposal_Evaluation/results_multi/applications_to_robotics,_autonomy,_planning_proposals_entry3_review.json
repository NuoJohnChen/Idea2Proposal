    "Summary": "The proposal develops a hierarchical planning framework for autonomous robots in dynamic environments, combining learned predictive models with task decomposition. It features uncertainty-aware decomposition, adaptive mid-level policy learning, and a real-time safety layer. Validation includes simulation, real-world deployment, and human-in-the-loop evaluation.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Innovative integration of learned models with hierarchical planning.",
        "Comprehensive experimental plan with multiple validation stages.",
        "Clear focus on robustness and safety in dynamic environments.",
        "Potential for broad impact in domains like search-and-rescue and agile manufacturing."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Computational overhead of Bayesian neural networks and MCTS may limit real-time performance.",
        "Scaling to multi-robot coordination lacks concrete implementation details.",
        "Safety layer assumes perfect sensor inputs; robustness to noisy perception is unclear.",
        "Human-in-the-loop evaluation lacks predefined metrics for interpretability and trust."

    "Questions": [
        "What hardware constraints (e.g., CPU/GPU) are assumed for real-time deployment?",
        "How will the safety layer handle sensor failures or adversarial perturbations?",
        "Can the framework maintain stability if high-level uncertainty estimates diverge from ground truth?",
        "What specific criteria (e.g., plan readability, intervention frequency) will quantify interpretability in human studies?"

    "Limitations": [
        "Integration of multiple complex components may introduce unforeseen technical challenges.",
        "Real-world deployment may reveal limitations not captured in simulation.",
        "Scalability to multi-robot coordination is untested and may require significant modifications.",
        "Human-in-the-loop evaluation may not fully capture the complexities of real-world operator interactions."
