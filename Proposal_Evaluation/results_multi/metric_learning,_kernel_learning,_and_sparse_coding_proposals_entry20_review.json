    "Summary": "The proposal seeks to unify metric learning, kernel learning, and sparse coding into a joint optimization framework to enhance representation learning. It addresses the limitations of each method in isolation and hypothesizes that their integration will yield more robust and scalable representations. The proposed method includes a joint optimization framework, efficient training strategies, and interpretable feature learning. The experiment plan covers synthetic validation, benchmarking, scalability testing, interpretability analysis, and downstream task evaluation.",
