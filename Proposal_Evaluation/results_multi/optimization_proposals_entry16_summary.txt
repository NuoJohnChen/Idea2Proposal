Weaknesses: Lack of detail on training the gating network and its computational overhead., Potential feasibility concerns regarding the integration of zeroth-order methods in high-dimensional spaces., Limited discussion on how the gating mechanism will generalize across diverse tasks., Unclear how the proposed method will scale to very high-dimensional problems.
