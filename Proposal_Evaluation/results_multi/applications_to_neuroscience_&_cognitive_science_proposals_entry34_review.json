    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a neurobiologically grounded attention model integrating top-down and bottom-up mechanisms, validated using neural data (EEG/fMRI) and behavioral tasks. It features a three-part approach: model architecture, neural data integration, and behavioral validation, with a detailed step-by-step experiment plan.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement.",
        "Intellectually ambitious hypothesis grounded in cognitive neuroscience literature.",
        "Comprehensive three-part approach and detailed experiment plan.",
        "Strong alignment with cognitive neuroscience principles."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks detailed discussion on technical challenges (e.g., multi-modal neural data integration).",
        "Execution feasibility of real-time dynamic gating mechanisms is not thoroughly addressed.",
        "Validation plan could be more explicit on performance quantification against baselines.",
        "No discussion on potential ethical concerns related to human neural data use."
