    "Summary": "The proposal aims to bridge the gap between correlation and causation in neural networks by integrating causal reasoning into scalable neural architectures. It proposes a hybrid approach combining gradient-based learning with symbolic causal operations, focusing on causal graph induction, intervention-aware training, and scalable integration into transformer-based architectures. The experiment plan includes validation, generalization, real-world tasks, scalability, and ablation studies.",
