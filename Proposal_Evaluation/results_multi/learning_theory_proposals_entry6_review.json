    "Summary": "The proposal seeks to develop a unified framework for provable generalization in deep neural networks by combining insights from algorithmic regularization and data-dependent structure. It aims to derive new complexity measures and generalization bounds that account for the implicit bias of gradient descent and the effective dimensionality of learned representations.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement.",
        "Ambitious and original hypothesis that addresses a significant gap in the field.",
        "Detailed and logically sequenced experiment plan.",
        "Strong scientific rigor with comprehensive validation strategies."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lack of concrete details on practical implementation of theoretical derivations.",
        "Ambitions scope may be overly optimistic, especially in scaling to real-world models.",
        "Limited discussion on potential pitfalls and alternative approaches."

    "Limitations": [
        "Theoretical derivations may not generalize to all architectures or optimization methods.",
