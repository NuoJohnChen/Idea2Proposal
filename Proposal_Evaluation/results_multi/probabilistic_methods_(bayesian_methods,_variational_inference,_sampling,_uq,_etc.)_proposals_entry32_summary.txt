Weaknesses: Lacks depth in addressing potential technical challenges (e.g., convergence guarantees for adaptive VI, computational overhead of Hessian-vector products)., Risks (e.g., scalability to billion-parameter models) are not thoroughly discussed., Validation plan could benefit from more critical analyses (e.g., failure modes of gradient-based tempered MCMC).
