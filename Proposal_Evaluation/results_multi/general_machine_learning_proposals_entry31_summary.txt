Weaknesses: Lacks specificity in the exact nature of the new generalization bounds and their derivation., Feasibility of scaling experiments to very large datasets is questionable without more details on computational resources., Execution plan could benefit from more concrete details on benchmark curation and validation., Validation plan lacks depth in how theoretical predictions will be empirically validated.
