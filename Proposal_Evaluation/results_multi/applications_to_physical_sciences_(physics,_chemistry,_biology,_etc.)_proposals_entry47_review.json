    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a hybrid architecture combining neural operators with adaptive numerical solvers to address computational challenges in multiscale physical systems. It hypothesizes that a gating mechanism can dynamically allocate computational resources, improving performance for discontinuous or high-frequency features. The method includes a gated neural operator architecture, a hybrid numerical-ML solver, and efficient training via domain decomposition. The experiment plan covers canonical PDEs, multiscale materials, chemical reactions, and real-world validation.",
