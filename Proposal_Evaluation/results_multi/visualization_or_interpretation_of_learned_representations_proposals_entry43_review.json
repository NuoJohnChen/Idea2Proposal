    "Summary": "The proposal aims to enhance the interpretability of deep neural networks by developing a framework that combines feature disentanglement, causal analysis, and interactive visualization. It addresses the opacity of learned representations in DNNs and proposes a systematic approach to quantify and visualize feature semantics and interactions.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and relevant problem statement addressing a significant gap in DNN interpretability.",
        "Strong motivation building on prior work while proposing a novel, unified framework.",
        "Comprehensive proposed method integrating multiple techniques (sparse autoencoders, causal intervention, visualization tools).",
        "Detailed and varied experiment plan, including benchmark metrics, layer-wise analysis, human studies, and downstream task validation."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks detailed discussion on scalability challenges of sparse autoencoders for large models.",
        "Feasibility concerns regarding causal intervention analysis, especially in large-scale models.",
        "Human-judged interpretability scores may introduce subjectivity, which is not thoroughly addressed.",
        "Potential biases in evaluation metrics are not critically analyzed.",
        "Risk mitigation strategies for technical challenges are insufficiently detailed."

        "How will potential biases in the disentanglement metrics be addressed?",
        "What are the fallback strategies if the proposed disentanglement methods fail to generalize across different architectures?",

        "Scalability of sparse autoencoders to large-scale models like ViT may be limited.",
