    "Summary": "The proposal introduces an adaptive gradient method for non-stationary objectives, combining non-stationarity detection, meta-learned adaptation, and efficient implementation. It aims to improve upon traditional optimizers like Adam by dynamically adjusting hyperparameters based on real-time estimates of non-stationarity.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Addresses a significant and timely problem in optimization for non-stationary objectives.",
        "Well-motivated hypothesis linking fixed adaptation rules to suboptimal performance in dynamic environments.",
        "Innovative combination of non-stationarity detection and meta-learned adaptation.",
        "Detailed and rigorous experimental plan, including synthetic benchmarks, dynamic deep learning tasks, and adversarial shifts."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Feasibility concerns regarding the computational overhead of the meta-learning component.",
        "Scalability claims (O(d) time complexity) need more empirical validation.",
        "Limited emphasis on real-world applications beyond synthetic benchmarks.",
        "Potential risks in the efficient implementation of the meta-updates."

    "Questions": [
        "How will the meta-learner be trained end-to-end with the main model without introducing significant computational overhead?",
        "What are the specific metrics for detecting non-stationarity, and how will they be validated?",
        "Can the proposed method scale to very large models (e.g., GPT-3 scale) without compromising efficiency?",
        "What are the potential failure modes of the non-stationarity detection module?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "Computational overhead of the meta-learning component may limit practical applicability.",
        "Scalability to very large models is not fully demonstrated.",
        "The method may be sensitive to the choice of non-stationarity detection metrics."
