    "Summary": "The proposal aims to optimize distributed training infrastructure for large-scale AI models through a hardware-software co-design approach, targeting communication overhead, hardware underutilization, and memory constraints. It proposes a three-part framework involving dynamic communication scheduling, adaptive hardware mapping, and memory-efficient checkpointing. The experiment plan includes benchmarking, evaluation, and ablation studies to validate the proposed solutions.",
