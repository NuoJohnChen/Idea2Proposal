    "Summary": "The proposal introduces adaptive model-based priors (AMPs) to improve the sample efficiency of reinforcement learning by dynamically adjusting trust in learned models based on uncertainty and task-specific utility. The method includes uncertainty-aware model learning, a dynamic trust mechanism, and stabilized policy optimization. The experiment plan is comprehensive, covering validation, benchmarking, scaling, generalization, and theoretical analysis.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Novel and well-motivated central idea (AMPs) to address a significant problem in RL.",
        "Detailed and comprehensive proposed method, including uncertainty-aware model learning and dynamic trust mechanism.",
        "Strong experiment plan with validation, benchmarking, scaling, generalization, and theoretical analysis.",
        "Clear plan for ablation studies and comparisons with strong baselines."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks explicit discussion of potential technical challenges and risks, particularly in scaling the trust network and integrating it with the actor-critic framework.",
        "Theoretical analysis, while planned, is not yet developed, and its feasibility is not discussed in detail."
