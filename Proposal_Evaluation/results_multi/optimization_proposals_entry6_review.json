    "Summary": "The proposal introduces AdaCurv, an adaptive optimizer that leverages curvature-aware updates and gradient coherence filtering to improve convergence and generalization in non-convex optimization landscapes. The method combines low-rank Hessian approximation, gradient coherence scores, and memory-efficient Kronecker-factored updates. The experiment plan includes synthetic benchmarks, deep learning tasks, language model pretraining, theoretical analysis, and hardware efficiency benchmarks.",
