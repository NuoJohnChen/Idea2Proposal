Weaknesses: Lack of detail on learning dynamic regularization strength in EWC++., Unaddressed scalability concerns for memory banks in long-sequence tasks., Theoretical analysis is not well-integrated into the experimental plan., Potential high computational overhead from the hypernetwork and memory mechanisms., Feasibility of the attention-based retrieval mechanism is not thoroughly explored.
