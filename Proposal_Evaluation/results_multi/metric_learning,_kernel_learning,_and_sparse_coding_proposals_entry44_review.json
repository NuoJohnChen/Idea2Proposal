    "Summary": "The proposal seeks to unify metric learning, kernel learning, and sparse coding into a single framework for robust representation learning. It identifies limitations in existing methods and hypothesizes that their integration can yield more robust and interpretable representations. The proposed method involves adaptive kernel metric learning, sparse coding in kernel space, and end-to-end joint optimization. The experiment plan includes validation of kernel-metric synergy, sparse coding efficacy, end-to-end evaluation, ablation studies, and scalability tests.",
