    "Summary": "The proposal introduces adaptive model-based priors (AMPs) to improve reinforcement learning efficiency by dynamically adjusting model-based predictions based on uncertainty and task relevance. The method includes uncertainty-aware dynamics learning, adaptive prior weighting, and task-aware transfer learning, with a comprehensive experiment plan covering validation, benchmarking, transfer evaluation, scaling, and ablation studies.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and compelling problem statement highlighting limitations of current RL methods.",
        "Novel hypothesis proposing dynamic adjustment of model-based priors.",
        "Detailed three-part framework for implementing AMPs.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan with validation, benchmarking, transfer evaluation, scaling, and ablation studies."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "The end-to-end optimization of the gating mechanism is not detailed, raising questions about its feasibility.",
        "Scalability to pixel-based observations is asserted but not backed by technical justification or preliminary results.",
        "No discussion of computational trade-offs or hardware requirements for large-scale experiments."
