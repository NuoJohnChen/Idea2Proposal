    "Summary": "The proposal introduces an adaptive model-based prior approach to improve sample efficiency in RL by dynamically blending model-free and model-based updates based on uncertainty and empirical error. It includes uncertainty-calibrated dynamics models, adaptive policy optimization, and efficient planning with selective model use. The experimental plan covers validation, benchmarking, scaling, and ablation studies.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement.",
        "Compelling hypothesis with a novel approach to blending model-free and model-based updates.",
        "Detailed and thorough proposed method with three distinct components.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan including validation, benchmarking, scaling, and ablation studies."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Novelty of the core idea is limited; adaptive model usage has been explored in prior work.",
        "Lacks detailed discussion on potential technical challenges and risks, such as computational overhead.",
        "Scalability to very high-dimensional state spaces is not fully explored."
