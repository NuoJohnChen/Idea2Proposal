    "Summary": "The proposal aims to unify metric learning, kernel learning, and sparse coding into a single framework for robust representation learning. It hypothesizes that combining these paradigms can overcome their individual limitations, leading to more discriminative and efficient representations. The proposed method includes metric-learning-guided kernel design, sparse kernel approximation, and end-to-end optimization. The experiment plan covers synthetic data validation, benchmarking on standard tasks, scalability analysis, interpretability evaluation, and real-world deployment.",
