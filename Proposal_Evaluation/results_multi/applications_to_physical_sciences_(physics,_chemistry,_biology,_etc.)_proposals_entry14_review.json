    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a multiscale neural operator (MNO) combining Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) with graph attention mechanisms to accelerate simulations of multiscale physical systems. It aims to overcome limitations of traditional numerical methods and current ML surrogates by learning resolution-invariant representations. The method is validated through experiments on canonical PDEs, molecular dynamics, multiphysics systems, and real-world generalization tasks.",
