    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a unified framework for representation learning that integrates unsupervised, self-supervised, semi-supervised, and supervised paradigms. It aims to dynamically leverage labeled and unlabeled data to achieve state-of-the-art performance across diverse data regimes and domains. The method includes a hybrid architecture with modular components, dynamic gradient balancing, and adaptive data routing. The experiment plan covers benchmarking, ablation studies, cross-domain generalization, and scalability tests.",
