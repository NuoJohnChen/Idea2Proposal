    "Summary": "The proposal integrates structured latent variable models with causal discovery frameworks to enable scalable and accurate causal inference. It hypothesizes that disentangling causal and non-causal latent variables, combined with gradient-based optimization of causal graphs, will address the gap between correlation and causation. The method includes structured latent causal models, gradient-based causal discovery, and identifiability guarantees. The experiment plan covers synthetic and real-world validation, interventional robustness, scalability benchmarking, and downstream task evaluation.",
