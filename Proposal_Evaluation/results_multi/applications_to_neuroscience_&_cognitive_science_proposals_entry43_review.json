    "Summary": "The proposal aims to integrate computational models of decision-making (RL and DDM) with neural data using a spiking neural network (SNN). It seeks to uncover neural circuit dynamics, account for individual differences, and apply findings to clinical contexts. The method involves hybrid model development, neural data alignment, and individual differences mapping, with a detailed experiment plan covering validation, neural predictions, perturbation experiments, clinical translation, and tool development.",
