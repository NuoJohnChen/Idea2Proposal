    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a framework for dynamic, multimodal, and bias-aware AI benchmarking to address limitations in current static, unimodal, and bias-blind benchmarks. It includes dynamic evaluation, multimodal task design, and bias quantification, with a detailed experiment plan covering validation, stress-testing, bias propagation analysis, efficiency testing, and longitudinal deployment.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement with relevant citations.",
        "Strong motivation and hypothesis that integrates multiple critical aspects of AI evaluation.",
        "Comprehensive proposed method with three key components addressing dynamic, multimodal, and bias-aware evaluation.",
        "Detailed experiment plan with specific steps to validate each component of the framework."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks detailed discussion on potential technical challenges, such as the feasibility of synthetic perturbations for counterfactual fairness testing.",
        "Computational overhead of dynamic evaluation is not thoroughly addressed.",
        "Experiment plan lacks specific metrics for success or failure, which could strengthen scientific rigor."
