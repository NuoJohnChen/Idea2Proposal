    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a holistic framework to address fairness, safety, and privacy in AI systems, arguing that these objectives are interconnected. It proposes unified metrics, adaptive constraint optimization, and post-deployment monitoring, with a detailed experiment plan including benchmark studies, validation of unified metrics, optimization ablations, safety-stress testing, and a longitudinal deployment study.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and compelling problem statement highlighting the limitations of current isolated approaches.",
        "Ambitious and intellectually deep hypothesis about the interconnectedness of fairness, safety, and privacy.",
        "Comprehensive proposed method combining unified metrics, adaptive optimization, and post-deployment monitoring.",
        "Rigorous validation plan with multiple stages of experimentation."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Feasibility concerns, particularly in scaling to large language models and conducting longitudinal deployment studies.",
        "Potential lack of depth in addressing emergent harms over time in the validation plan.",
        "Overly optimistic assumptions about the ease of integrating lightweight cryptographic techniques for privacy-preserving audits."

    "Questions": [
        "How will the proposed framework handle cases where the trade-offs between fairness, safety, and privacy are fundamentally irreconcilable?",
        "What specific lightweight cryptographic techniques will be used for privacy-preserving audits, and how will their overhead be managed?",
        "How will the longitudinal deployment study control for confounding variables that may affect societal metrics over time?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "Scalability to large language models may be challenging due to computational and algorithmic constraints.",
        "Longitudinal deployment studies are resource-intensive and may not capture all emergent harms.",
        "The framework may struggle with dynamically evolving societal norms and definitions of fairness, safety, and privacy."
