Weaknesses: Lacks explicit discussion of potential technical challenges (e.g., training stability of VRNN, computational overhead of MCTS)., Novelty of the hierarchical meta-planner compared to existing hierarchical RL methods could be more clearly delineated., Limited discussion of risk mitigation strategies for potential failures in real-world deployment.
