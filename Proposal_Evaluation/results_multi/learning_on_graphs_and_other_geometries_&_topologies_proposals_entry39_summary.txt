Overall Quality: 6
Argumentative Cohesion: 8
Intellectual Depth: 6
Execution Credibility: 4
Scientific Rigor: 7
Decision: Accept
Weaknesses: Limited novelty in proposed methods; heavily builds on existing techniques (e.g., hyperbolic convolutions, meta-learning)., Vague technical details on integrating diverse geometries (e.g., hyperbolic + spherical)., Scalability claims lack concrete implementation strategies for extreme-scale graphs., Minimal discussion of failure modes or risks in cross-geometry transfer.
