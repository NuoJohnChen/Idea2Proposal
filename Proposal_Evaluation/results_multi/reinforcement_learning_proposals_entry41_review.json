    "Summary": "The proposal introduces an adaptive prior weighting mechanism for reinforcement learning to improve sample efficiency by dynamically adjusting the reliance on model-based predictions based on localized uncertainty estimates. The method combines uncertainty-aware dynamics ensembles, adaptive prior weighting, and efficient hybrid learning, with a detailed experiment plan covering validation, comparison, long-horizon tasks, high-dimensional control, and computational trade-offs.",
