    "Summary": "The proposal aims to improve distributed deep learning by optimizing communication and memory efficiency through a hybrid communication protocol and a memory-centric runtime system. It targets scalability and efficiency in large-scale model training, with a detailed experiment plan and integration with existing frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-motivated problem statement addressing critical bottlenecks in distributed deep learning.",
        "Cohesive narrative linking the problem to the proposed solution.",
        "Detailed and comprehensive experiment plan, including benchmarking, scalability testing, and ablation studies.",
        "Credible execution plan leveraging existing frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow)."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Primarily incremental improvements over existing techniques (gradient compression, memory pooling) rather than novel paradigms.",
        "Hybrid protocol lacks concrete stability guarantees or failure-mode analysis.",
        "Memory management optimizations assume ideal workload patterns without addressing pathological cases.",
        "Scientific rigor could be strengthened with more explicit trade-off analyses and edge-case testing."

    "Questions": [
        "How will the hybrid protocol ensure convergence stability, especially in heterogeneous cluster environments?",
        "What are the specific thresholds or heuristics for switching between synchronous and asynchronous updates?",
        "How will the memory allocator handle extreme memory fragmentation scenarios?",
        "What are the expected overheads of dynamic memory management, and how will they be mitigated?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "Potential instability in hybrid communication protocols under high network contention or gradient variance.",
        "Scalability may be limited by hardware heterogeneity or extreme cluster sizes (e.g., 1,024 GPUs).",
        "Memory pooling efficiency may vary significantly across different model architectures and workloads.",
        "Integration with existing frameworks may introduce unforeseen compatibility issues."
