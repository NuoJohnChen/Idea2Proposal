    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a hybrid computational model combining reinforcement learning, attractor networks, and meta-learning to explain cognitive control dynamics. It plans to validate the model using synthetic tasks, fMRI, iEEG, and behavioral experiments, with potential clinical applications.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement highlighting a significant gap in the field.",
        "Innovative hypothesis proposing a hybrid model with meta-learning capabilities.",
        "Comprehensive experimental plan including model development, neural data integration, and behavioral validation.",
        "Strong potential for impact given the interdisciplinary approach and clinical relevance."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Feasibility concerns regarding the integration of diverse datasets (fMRI, iEEG, behavioral).",
        "Lack of detailed risk mitigation strategies for technical challenges.",
        "Overly ambitious scope, particularly the clinical translation step.",
        "Potential computational complexity of the hybrid model may pose implementation challenges."
