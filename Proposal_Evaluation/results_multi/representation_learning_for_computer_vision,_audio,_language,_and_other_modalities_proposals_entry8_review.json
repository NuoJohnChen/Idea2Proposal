    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a unified representation learning framework across vision, audio, and language modalities using a shared backbone, modality-specific adapters, and dynamic feature routing. It addresses the fragmentation in current modality-specific approaches and the inefficiency of heavy multimodal fusion architectures.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-motivated problem statement highlighting gaps in current research.",
        "Ambitious yet grounded hypothesis leveraging recent literature on shared latent spaces and parameter-efficient tuning.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan covering unimodal, cross-modal, and multimodal tasks with strong baselines.",
        "Good consideration of efficiency and practical deployment scenarios.",
        "Planned ablation studies to isolate contributions of key components."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks detailed discussion of technical challenges in designing a truly modality-agnostic backbone.",
        "Potential risks of adapter overfitting or routing mechanism instability are not thoroughly addressed.",
        "Limited discussion of how the dynamic routing mechanism will be trained or its scalability to many modalities.",
        "No mention of potential negative societal impacts or ethical considerations of unified multimodal models."

    "Questions": [
        "How will the shared backbone handle fundamental differences in modality statistics (e.g., text vs. audio temporal scales)?",
        "What safeguards will be in place to prevent the dynamic routing from collapsing to always use shared or adapter features?",
        "How will the framework scale to more than three modalities (e.g., adding tactile or olfactory data)?",
        "What are the concrete metrics for determining the optimal adapter size (0.1% to 5% range)?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "Potential difficulty in balancing shared and modality-specific features may lead to suboptimal performance in some domains.",
        "Dynamic routing mechanism may introduce significant computational overhead despite adapter efficiency claims.",
        "Generalization to truly unseen modalities (beyond slight distribution shifts) remains uncertain."
