    "Summary": "The proposal aims to optimize distributed training infrastructure for large-scale AI models through a hardware-software co-design approach, addressing inefficiencies in memory management, communication overhead, and hardware utilization. It proposes a unified memory allocator, topology-aware communication optimizations, and hardware-specific kernels, with a detailed experiment plan to validate improvements.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement identifying key bottlenecks in distributed training.",
        "Detailed and well-structured proposed method, leveraging prior work effectively.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan with strong baselines and validation metrics.",
        "Strong scientific rigor with a focus on benchmarking and profiling."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Reliance on prior work without clear paradigm-shifting novelty.",
        "Limited discussion of potential risks and scalability limits.",
        "Incremental improvements to existing techniques may lack significant intellectual depth."
