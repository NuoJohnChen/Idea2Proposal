    "Summary": "The proposal aims to enhance autonomous navigation by integrating hierarchical world models with uncertainty quantification, using a three-tier neural-symbolic architecture (diffusion-based latent dynamics, GNNs, probabilistic logic) and a meta-policy for adaptive planning. The experiment plan includes validation, benchmarking, real-world trials, and ablation studies.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement.",
        "Ambitious hypothesis integrating hierarchical reasoning and probabilistic modeling.",
        "Detailed method with a three-tier architecture and meta-policy.",
        "Thorough experiment plan covering validation, benchmarking, real-world trials, and ablations.",
        "Strong scientific rigor with comprehensive evaluation metrics."

    "Weaknesses": [
        "Feasibility concerns about integrating complex components into a cohesive system.",
        "Lack of detailed discussion on potential failure modes and scalability challenges.",
        "Optimistic assumptions about computational overhead and real-time deployment.",
