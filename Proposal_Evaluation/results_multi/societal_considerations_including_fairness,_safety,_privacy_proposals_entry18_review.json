    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a framework for societal alignment in AI systems, addressing fairness, safety, and privacy through a unified approach. It hypothesizes that a societal alignment loss function can mitigate trade-offs between these objectives. The method includes trade-off modeling, a modular architecture, and efficient co-training techniques. The experiment plan involves benchmarking, dynamic fairness validation, privacy-safety interaction testing, end-to-end evaluation, and user studies.",
