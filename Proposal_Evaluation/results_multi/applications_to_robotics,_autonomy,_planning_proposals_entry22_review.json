    "Summary": "The proposal aims to enhance autonomous navigation by integrating hierarchical world models with uncertainty quantification. It addresses limitations in current modular and learning-based approaches, proposing a novel method that combines hierarchical latent-space planning, diffusion-based planning, and meta-learning for robust and interpretable decision-making. The experimental plan includes validation of uncertainty quantification, benchmarking hierarchical planning, evaluating robustness to distribution shifts, and scaling to multi-agent settings.",
