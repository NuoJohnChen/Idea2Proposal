    "Summary": "The proposal aims to bridge the gap between correlation and causation in machine learning by developing a hybrid framework that combines deep learning with causal theory. It proposes three main components: latent causal representation learning, differentiable causal discovery, and counterfactual-aware training. The experiment plan includes validation on synthetic and real-world datasets, benchmarking against established methods, and scaling to high-dimensional data.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement.",
        "Strong motivation and hypothesis that addresses a significant gap in the field.",
        "Ambitious and innovative proposed method combining deep learning and causal theory.",
        "Detailed and comprehensive experiment plan with multiple metrics and ablation studies."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Feasibility concerns due to the complexity of integrating multiple advanced techniques.",
        "Lack of detailed discussion on potential pitfalls and how they will be addressed.",
        "Overly ambitious intellectual depth may not be fully achievable given current state of the field.",
        "Limited discussion on validation strategies and potential biases in datasets."
