    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a hybrid neural operator architecture combining adaptive attention mechanisms with physics-informed constraints to improve the simulation of multiscale physical systems. It targets limitations in current neural operators, such as handling long-range dependencies and complex boundary conditions, and proposes a method that integrates gating mechanisms, physics-informed regularization, and efficient multiscale training. The experiment plan includes benchmarking on canonical PDEs, materials science applications, chemistry systems, scalability analysis, and real-world validation.",
