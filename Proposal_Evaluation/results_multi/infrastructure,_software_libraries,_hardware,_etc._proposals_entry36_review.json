    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a scalable infrastructure for distributed deep learning by optimizing communication and hardware utilization. It combines adaptive communication protocols and hardware-aware scheduling to address inefficiencies in existing frameworks. The proposed method includes an adaptive communication layer, a hardware-aware scheduler, and a unified API for heterogeneous hardware. The experiment plan is comprehensive, covering benchmarking, gradient compression, scheduling validation, end-to-end comparison, and ablation studies.",
