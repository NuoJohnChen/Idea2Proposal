    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a theoretical framework for understanding adaptive learning dynamics in non-convex optimization, focusing on gradient descent and its variants. It hypothesizes that implicit adaptive behavior explains the empirical success of these methods and proposes to model optimization as a stochastic dynamical system. The method involves dynamical system modeling, curvature-adaptive step sizes, and escape time analysis, with experiments on synthetic landscapes, DNN dynamics, scaling laws, and generalization bounds.",
