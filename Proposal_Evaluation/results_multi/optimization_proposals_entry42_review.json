    "Summary": "The proposal introduces EGZO, a hybrid optimization framework combining evolutionary strategies and zeroth-order methods to address limitations of gradient-based optimization in non-convex, high-dimensional problems. It aims to leverage evolutionary exploration and zeroth-order refinement for better scalability and robustness.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement identifying limitations of existing methods",
        "Plausible hypothesis about complementary strengths of evolutionary and zeroth-order methods",
        "Comprehensive experimental plan covering synthetic benchmarks, hyperparameter optimization, and reinforcement learning tasks",
        "Potential for broad impact given the ubiquity of optimization in machine learning"
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Insufficient differentiation from existing hybrid approaches in the literature",
        "Lack of technical depth in describing key components (e.g., adaptive resource allocation)",
        "Overly ambitious scalability claims without sufficient feasibility analysis",
        "Experimental plan doesn't clearly isolate contributions of different components",
        "Inadequate discussion of computational costs for maintaining population diversity in high dimensions"

    "Questions": [
        "How does EGZO fundamentally differ from existing hybrid evolutionary-gradient methods?",
        "What specific theoretical guarantees can be provided for the adaptive resource allocation?",
        "How will the method maintain population diversity in very high-dimensional spaces (e.g., 10,000 parameters)?",
        "What are the expected computational costs of maintaining parallel evaluations at scale?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "Potential high computational cost of maintaining population diversity in high dimensions",
        "Risk of the hybrid approach inheriting weaknesses of both methods rather than strengths",
        "Unclear how the method will perform when gradient information is extremely noisy or unreliable",
        "Scalability claims may not hold in practice due to memory/computational constraints"
