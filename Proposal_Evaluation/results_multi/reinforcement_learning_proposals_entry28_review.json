    "Summary": "The proposal aims to improve the sample efficiency of reinforcement learning (RL) by integrating adaptive model-based priors that dynamically adjust their influence on policy optimization based on uncertainty. The method combines uncertainty-adaptive models, hierarchical policy decomposition, and directed curiosity, with a comprehensive experiment plan covering synthetic tasks, benchmark comparisons, long-horizon tasks, sparse-reward environments, and real-world transfer.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-motivated problem statement.",
        "Innovative combination of uncertainty-adaptive models, hierarchical policy decomposition, and directed curiosity.",
        "Comprehensive and well-structured experiment plan.",
        "Strong potential for impact given the critical bottleneck of sample inefficiency in RL."

    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks detailed discussion of potential technical challenges and risks.",
        "Could provide clearer justification for the choice of baselines and evaluation metrics.",
        "Real-world transfer experiments are ambitious and may face unforeseen practical challenges."
