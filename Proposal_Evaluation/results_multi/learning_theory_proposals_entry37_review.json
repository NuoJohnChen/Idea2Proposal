    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a theoretical framework for adaptive learning dynamics in non-convex optimization, aiming to unify adaptive optimization with provable non-convex convergence. It combines curvature-adaptive step sizes, momentum with escape guarantees, and global-local hybrid dynamics, with a comprehensive experiment plan covering synthetic landscapes, deep networks, language models, theoretical bounds, and real-world scalability.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement highlighting limitations of gradient-based methods in non-convex landscapes.",
        "Strong motivation supported by recent theoretical and empirical work.",
        "Ambitious and theoretically grounded proposed method.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan covering multiple aspects of optimization.",
        "High scientific rigor with detailed validation strategies."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Feasibility of integrating proposed components is uncertain.",
        "Lacks detailed discussion on potential technical challenges (e.g., computational overhead of Hessian-vector products).",
        "Execution credibility is undermined by ambitious scope.",
        "Limited detail on risk mitigation strategies."
