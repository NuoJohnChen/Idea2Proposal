Weaknesses: Feasibility concerns with handling extremely diverse modalities (e.g., tactile, time-series)., Potential computational costs and scalability issues not fully addressed., Risks associated with modality dropout (e.g., instability, poor convergence) are not discussed., Limited discussion on how to handle modality-specific nuances (e.g., temporal vs. spatial dynamics).
