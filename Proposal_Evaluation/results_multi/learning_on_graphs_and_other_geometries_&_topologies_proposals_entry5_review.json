    "Summary": "The proposal aims to generalize neural networks to arbitrary geometries and topologies by integrating geometric-aware message passing, higher-order topological invariants, and adaptive computation mechanisms. It targets applications in molecular dynamics, 3D shape analysis, and dynamical systems, addressing limitations in current GNN capabilities.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Ambitious and theoretically rich framework combining differential geometry, persistent homology, and sheaf theory.",
        "Clear and compelling problem statement identifying gaps in current GNN capabilities.",
        "Strong motivation and hypothesis addressing significant research gaps.",
