    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a biologically plausible dynamic gating mechanism for attention, bridging computational models and cognitive neuroscience. It hypothesizes that such a mechanism can better explain behavioral and neural data, and proposes a hybrid model integrating gated recurrent networks with neural dynamics. The validation plan includes synthetic tasks, electrophysiological data fitting, cross-modal generalization, and clinical translation.",
