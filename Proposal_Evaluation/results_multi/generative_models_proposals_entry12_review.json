    "Summary": "The proposal introduces Dynamic Latent Generative Models (DLGM), a framework to bridge the gap between expressivity and efficiency in generative models by using dynamic latent structures. The method includes input-adaptive latent allocation, hierarchical refinement with early exit, and efficient training via latent sparsity regularization. The experiment plan covers validation, benchmarking, scalability testing, ablation studies, and downstream applications.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-motivated problem statement.",
