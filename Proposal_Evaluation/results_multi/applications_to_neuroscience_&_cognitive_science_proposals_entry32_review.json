    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a spiking neural network (SNN) to model dynamic attentional mechanisms, bridging computational models and cognitive neuroscience. It identifies gaps in current models and neuroimaging tools, proposes a hypothesis grounded in the 'communication through coherence' framework, and outlines a detailed method integrating SNNs with MEG/EEG data and behavioral tasks. The experiment plan includes benchmarking, oscillatory coupling tests, behavioral predictions, perturbation experiments, and generalization to multisensory attention.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement identifying gaps in current models and tools.",
        "Well-motivated hypothesis building on established frameworks.",
        "Detailed and methodologically sound proposed method.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan with multiple validation steps."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks discussion of potential technical challenges in fitting SNNs to MEG/EEG data.",
        "Behavioral validation step may overlook individual variability.",
        "Generalization to multisensory attention may dilute the core hypothesis."
