Decision: Accept
Weaknesses: Limited novelty, as the proposed solutions build heavily on existing work., Lacks depth in addressing potential technical challenges (e.g., scalability of learned policy in adaptive gradient synchronization)., Experimental plan could benefit from more critical analyses (e.g., ablation studies)., Scalability claims beyond 2,048 GPUs are not thoroughly discussed., NVIDIA H100-specific optimizations may limit broader applicability.
