    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a neurosymbolic framework that tightly couples neural networks with symbolic reasoning to achieve robust and interpretable AI. It addresses the limitations of current hybrid systems by proposing differentiable symbolic grounding, physics-informed neural constraints, and dynamic neurosymbolic execution. The experiment plan spans multiple domains to validate the framework's effectiveness.",
