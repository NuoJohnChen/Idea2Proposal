    "Summary": "The proposal aims to unify metric learning, kernel learning, and sparse coding into a single framework to overcome their individual limitations. It proposes a hybrid loss function, efficient kernel approximation, and a unified optimization framework. The experiment plan includes synthetic validation, benchmarking, few-shot learning, robustness testing, and scalability analysis.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Ambitious and potentially impactful goal of unifying three powerful paradigms.",
        "Clear problem statement and well-articulated hypothesis.",
