    "Summary": "The proposal aims to bridge the gap between Euclidean and non-Euclidean domains in deep learning by combining geometric priors with adaptive computation. It addresses key challenges like over-smoothing, scalability, and generalization in graph neural networks (GNNs) through curvature-adaptive architectures, dynamic topology learning, and scalable training strategies.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement.",
        "Ambitious hypothesis with potential for significant impact.",
        "Detailed and structured proposed method.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan covering synthetic and real-world datasets.",
        "Includes theoretical analysis to support empirical results."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Feasibility of integrating differential geometry with learnable sparsity patterns is not fully explored.",
        "Limited discussion on potential technical challenges and alternative approaches.",
        "Theoretical analysis, while mentioned, lacks depth in the proposal."

    "Limitations": [
        "Integration of differential geometry with learnable sparsity may introduce computational overhead.",
        "Dynamic topology learning might not generalize well to all types of graphs.",
        "Theoretical guarantees may be hard to derive for arbitrary geometries."
