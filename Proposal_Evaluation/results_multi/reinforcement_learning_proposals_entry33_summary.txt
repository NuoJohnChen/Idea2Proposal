Weaknesses: Lacks detailed discussion of computational overhead and training complexity for the ensemble of probabilistic neural networks and trust gate., Experiment plan does not address partial observability or non-stationary dynamics, limiting broader applicability., No clear baseline comparison against other uncertainty-aware methods (e.g., Bayesian RL)., Potential risks and pitfalls of the proposed method are not thoroughly explored.
