    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a Unified Adaptive Learner (UAL) framework that integrates transfer, meta, and lifelong learning to address adaptability gaps in AI systems. It combines pre-trained transformers, task-specific adapters, and memory banks for knowledge composition, meta-training for generalization, and a lifelong adaptation protocol. The experiment plan includes benchmarks, ablations, stress tests, and real-world deployment.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement identifying gaps in current AI adaptability approaches.",
        "Ambitious and novel hypothesis integrating three learning paradigms.",
        "Detailed and comprehensive experiment plan covering diverse evaluation scenarios.",
        "Leverages established components (transformers, adapters, memory banks) in a novel combination."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Feasibility concerns due to high computational costs and integration complexity.",
        "Lack of detailed discussion on potential failure modes or alternative approaches.",
        "Overly ambitious scope may dilute focus and impact.",
        "Potential conflicts between the objectives of the three learning paradigms."

    "Limitations": [
        "High computational cost may limit scalability.",
        "Integration complexity could lead to suboptimal performance in individual paradigms.",
