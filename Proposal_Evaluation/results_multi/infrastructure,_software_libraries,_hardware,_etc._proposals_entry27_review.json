    "Summary": "The proposal aims to optimize distributed training infrastructure for large-scale AI models through a hardware-software co-design approach. It identifies key bottlenecks in current systems and proposes a unified framework integrating hardware-aware communication primitives, memory-centric training runtime, and adaptive parallelism scheduler. The experiment plan includes benchmarking existing frameworks, validating hardware optimizations, evaluating memory systems, testing adaptive parallelism, and measuring end-to-end training efficiency.",
