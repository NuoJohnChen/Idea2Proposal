    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a systematic method for visualizing and disentangling learned features in deep neural networks by combining geometric analysis of latent spaces with semantically grounded probing tasks. It introduces a novel metric, 'concept purity,' and an interactive visualization tool. The work addresses a significant gap in interpretable AI and includes a detailed experimental plan covering multiple architectures and tasks.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement.",
        "Strong motivation and compelling hypothesis.",
        "Comprehensive proposed method with geometric disentanglement, concept-based probing, and visualization.",
        "Detailed and structured experiment plan."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Limited discussion on potential technical challenges and scalability issues.",
        "Lacks detailed risk assessment and mitigation strategies.",
        "Generalizability of the concept purity metric is not thoroughly explored."
