Weaknesses: Primarily incremental improvements over existing techniques (gradient compression, memory pooling) rather than novel paradigms., Hybrid protocol lacks concrete stability guarantees or failure-mode analysis., Memory management optimizations assume ideal workload patterns without addressing pathological cases., Scientific rigor could be strengthened with more explicit trade-off analyses and edge-case testing.
