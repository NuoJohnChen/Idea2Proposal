Overall Quality: 8
Argumentative Cohesion: 7
Intellectual Depth: 9
Execution Credibility: 6
Scientific Rigor: 6
Decision: Reject
Weaknesses: Lacks technical depth in key components (e.g., supervision gate, gradient balancing)., Experiment plan is broad but lacks specificity in addressing potential technical challenges., Minimal discussion of computational overhead or scalability trade-offs.
