Weaknesses: Feasibility concerns regarding the integration of diverse systems (FNOs and GNNs), particularly in maintaining consistency between continuum and discrete scales., High computational cost of enforcing physical constraints across scales may limit scalability., Lacks detailed contingency plans if the primary method fails, especially in handling non-linear or chaotic systems., Potential over-optimism in real-world deployment scalability, given the complexity of multiscale systems.
