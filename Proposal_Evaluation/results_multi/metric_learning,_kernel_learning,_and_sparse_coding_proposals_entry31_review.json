    "Summary": "The proposal seeks to unify metric learning, kernel learning, and sparse coding into a single framework to address scalability, computational complexity, and interpretability issues. It proposes a joint optimization framework with learnable kernel functions, sparse kernel embeddings, and adaptive regularization. The experimental plan includes synthetic data validation, benchmarking on image and text datasets, efficiency analysis, robustness testing, and downstream task transfer.",
