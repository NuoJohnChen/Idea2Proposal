    "Summary": "The proposal seeks to bridge computational models (spiking neural networks) and human brain dynamics (EEG-fMRI) to elucidate the neural mechanisms of cognitive control, focusing on PFC and beta-band synchronization. It includes model development, neural data integration, and behavioral validation.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement highlighting gaps in current methods.",
        "Ambitious hypothesis proposing a hybrid approach.",
        "Detailed method with clear steps for model development and validation.",
        "Comprehensive experimental plan including perturbation experiments."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Feasibility concerns about integrating SNNs with EEG-fMRI data.",
        "Overly ambitious given the technical challenges.",
        "Lacks detailed discussion on potential pitfalls or alternative approaches.",
        "Limited discussion on the scalability of the model to real-world tasks."
