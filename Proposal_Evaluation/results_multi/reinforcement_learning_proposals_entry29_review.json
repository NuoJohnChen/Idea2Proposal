    "Summary": "The proposal introduces an RL framework that uses adaptive model-based priors to improve sample efficiency and robustness by dynamically weighting model-based and model-free updates. It combines uncertainty-aware dynamics modeling, adaptive prior weighting, and a hybrid learning architecture. The experiment plan includes validation, ablation studies, benchmarking, generalization, and scalability tests.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement highlighting limitations of current RL methods.",
        "Compelling hypothesis on dynamic weighting improving sample efficiency and robustness.",
        "Detailed proposed method with three well-defined components.",
        "Thorough experiment plan covering multiple aspects of validation and evaluation."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Feasibility concerns about the adaptive weighting mechanism.",
        "Lack of discussion on potential failure modes and mitigation strategies.",
        "Computational overhead of the hybrid architecture is not fully addressed.",
        "Limited discussion on how the method would scale to very complex environments."

        "How will the method perform in environments with highly non-stationary dynamics?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "Potential inaccuracies in uncertainty estimation could lead to suboptimal weighting.",
        "Computational overhead may limit scalability to very large-scale tasks.",
        "Generalization to unseen environments may be challenging if the dynamics model is not robust."
