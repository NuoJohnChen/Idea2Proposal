Weaknesses: Overly ambitious execution plan, especially large-scale and biological plausibility components., Feasibility of theoretical claims (e.g., convergence proofs) is uncertain., Experimental plan could be more focused on core claims., Potential computational overhead may limit practical applicability., Lack of preliminary results to support high-risk theoretical claims.
