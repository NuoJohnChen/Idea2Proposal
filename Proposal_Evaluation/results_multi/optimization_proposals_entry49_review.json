    "Summary": "The proposal introduces an adaptive optimization framework for non-stationary objectives, leveraging dynamic gradient memory and learning-rate adaptation via gradient coherence scores (GCS). It targets meta-learning, adversarial training, and continual learning applications with a detailed experiment plan and theoretical analysis.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Novel and well-motivated core idea (adaptive gradient memory).",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan spanning synthetic tasks and real-world applications.",
        "Clear connection to existing literature and methods.",
        "Strong emphasis on validation and theoretical grounding."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Insufficient discussion on computational overhead of GCS and LSTM controller.",
        "Scalability to large-scale models (e.g., transformers) is uncertain.",
        "Baseline comparisons lack recent optimizers (e.g., RAdam, Lookahead).",
        "Potential failure modes of GCS (e.g., noise sensitivity) are underexplored."
