    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a theoretical framework for adaptive learning dynamics in non-convex optimization, addressing the gap between empirical success and theoretical understanding of methods like Adam and SGD. It hypothesizes that adaptive methods exploit geometric properties of loss landscapes to navigate toward flatter minima. The proposed method includes SDE modeling, analysis of saddle point escape rates, and generalization bounds. The experiment plan involves validation on synthetic and real-world datasets, benchmarking escape rates, and scaling to high dimensions.",
