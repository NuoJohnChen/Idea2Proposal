Overall Quality: 6
Argumentative Cohesion: 7
Intellectual Depth: 7
Execution Credibility: 5
Scientific Rigor: 6
Decision: Reject
Weaknesses: Execution plan lacks depth in addressing potential technical challenges (e.g., computational overhead, scalability)., Experimental plan could benefit from more rigorous baselines and deeper ablation studies., Feasibility of integrating symbolic reasoning and intersectional fairness metrics in practice is uncertain., Lacks novelty in the proposed methods, which are combinations of existing techniques.
