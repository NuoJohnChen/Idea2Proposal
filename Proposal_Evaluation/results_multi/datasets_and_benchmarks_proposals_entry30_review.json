{
    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a framework for evaluating dataset quality and model generalization in limited-data regimes, addressing the overemphasis on large-scale datasets in current AI benchmarking. It includes a dataset auditing toolkit, generalization benchmarks (MedShift, LinguaZero), and a unified scoring system (GRS).",
    "Strengths": [
        "Addresses a critical gap in AI benchmarking with a focus on dataset quality and generalization.",
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement.",
        "Strong motivation and hypothesis, supported by relevant literature.",
        "Comprehensive proposed method with multiple components (auditing, benchmarks, metric standardization).",
        "Strong scientific rigor with planned ablation studies and controlled experiments."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Feasibility concerns in building MedShift and LinguaZero benchmarks, particularly with synthetic medical images and endangered language data.",
        "Execution plan may be overly optimistic in terms of partnerships and data generation.",
        "Lack of detail on how community partnerships for LinguaZero will be established.",
        "Limited discussion on handling potential failures or unexpected results."

    "Questions": [
        "How will the synthetic medical images in MedShift be validated for realism and clinical relevance?",
        "What specific steps will be taken to ensure ethical and fair collaboration with endangered language communities for LinguaZero?",
        "How will the GRS be standardized across different domains (e.g., medical imaging vs. NLP)?",
        "What contingency plans are in place if partnerships with NIH or endangered language communities fall through?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "Potential challenges in generating realistic synthetic medical images.",
        "Difficulty in crowdsourcing translations for endangered languages.",
        "Risk of GRS not being universally applicable across all domains.",
        "Dependence on external partnerships introduces uncertainty."
