    "Summary": "The proposal develops a hybrid inference framework combining adaptive SG-MCMC, expressive VI with normalizing flows, and structured UQ techniques to bridge Bayesian methods and deep learning. It aims to address scalability and accuracy challenges in probabilistic methods for modern deep learning architectures.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement.",
        "Strong motivation grounded in recent advances in probabilistic methods.",
        "Detailed and comprehensive experiment plan with ablation studies.",
        "Cohesive narrative connecting problem, hypothesis, and method."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Limited discussion of technical challenges and risk mitigation strategies.",
        "Scalability concerns for very large models are not fully addressed.",
        "Novelty is incremental, primarily combining existing techniques (noted by Reviewer 5)."
