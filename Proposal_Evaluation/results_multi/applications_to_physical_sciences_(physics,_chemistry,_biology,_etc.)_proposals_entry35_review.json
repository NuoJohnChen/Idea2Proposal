    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a hybrid neural operator architecture integrating domain-specific inductive biases to accelerate simulations of multiscale physical systems. It combines spectral operator learning with physics-constrained loss functions and attention mechanisms, targeting improvements in accuracy, computational efficiency, and interpretability over traditional PDE solvers and current ML models. The experiment plan includes validation on canonical PDEs, molecular systems, high-energy physics, and hardware efficiency analysis.",
