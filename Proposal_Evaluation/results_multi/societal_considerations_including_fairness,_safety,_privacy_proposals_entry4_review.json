    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a multidisciplinary framework to jointly optimize fairness, safety, and privacy in AI systems. It includes a theoretical formulation, algorithmic co-design, and system-level deployment, with a detailed experiment plan covering benchmarks, validation, real-world testing, and human-in-the-loop evaluation.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Timely and critical problem statement with clear societal impact.",
        "Strong motivation and hypothesis grounded in prior work.",
        "Ambitious and comprehensive proposed method, covering theoretical, algorithmic, and system-level aspects.",
        "Detailed and rigorous experiment plan, including adversarial testing and human evaluations."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Feasibility concerns due to the complexity of joint optimization of multiple constraints.",
        "Scalability of the runtime monitor may be challenging, especially for real-time deployments.",
        "Potential over-optimism in achieving Pareto-optimal solutions under conflicting constraints.",
        "Lack of detailed discussion on resolving conflicting constraints in practice."

    "Questions": [
        "How will the proposed framework handle cases where fairness, safety, and privacy constraints are fundamentally incompatible?",
        "What are the specific metrics for evaluating the success of the runtime monitor in real-world deployments?",
        "How will the participatory design workshops ensure diverse and representative stakeholder input?",
        "Can the runtime monitoring latency target (<50ms per inference) be realistically achieved, and what are the trade-offs?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "The joint optimization approach may not always yield feasible solutions due to inherent conflicts between constraints.",
        "The runtime monitor's performance may degrade in high-throughput or resource-constrained environments.",
        "The human-in-the-loop evaluation may introduce subjective biases in assessing perceived fairness and trust.",
        "Generalizability of the framework to diverse domains and datasets is uncertain."
