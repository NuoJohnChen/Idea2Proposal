Weaknesses: Feasibility concerns in high-dimensional environments and computational overhead of BNNs or ensembles., Limited discussion on potential pitfalls and alternative approaches if the primary method fails., Real-world transfer might be overly optimistic given the complexity of robotic tasks., Lacks detailed discussion of potential technical challenges (e.g., training stability of BNNs or ensembles).
