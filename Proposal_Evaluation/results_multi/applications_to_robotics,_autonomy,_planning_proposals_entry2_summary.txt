Weaknesses: Feasibility of real-time integration on hardware like Boston Dynamics Spot is unclear., Computational overhead of uncertainty propagation and hierarchical modeling may limit scalability., Ablation studies lack specificity on how key components (e.g., uncertainty propagation) will be isolated., Trade-offs between model complexity and real-time performance are not quantified.
