    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a unified, scalable, and theoretically sound framework for geometric deep learning on non-Euclidean domains (graphs and manifolds) by combining spectral graph theory with neural differential equations. The method includes spectral graph operators with adaptive basis, neural geometric PDEs for manifolds, and a unified architecture for hybrid geometries. The experiment plan covers synthetic and real-world datasets, scalability tests, and ablation studies.",
