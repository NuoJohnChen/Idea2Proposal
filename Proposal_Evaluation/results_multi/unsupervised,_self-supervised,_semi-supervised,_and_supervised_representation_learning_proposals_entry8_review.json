    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a unified framework for representation learning by combining unsupervised, self-supervised, semi-supervised, and supervised paradigms into a hierarchical architecture with dynamic supervision weighting. The goal is to achieve robust performance across varying levels of supervision.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Ambitious and novel idea of unifying representation learning paradigms.",
        "Clear hierarchical architecture design with distinct tiers for each paradigm.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan including ablation studies and real-world deployment."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks detailed discussion on potential gradient conflicts between tiers.",
        "Overly optimistic about the feasibility of dynamic supervision weighting without empirical validation.",
        "Computational overhead of the proposed architecture is not addressed.",
        "No clear mitigation strategy for catastrophic forgetting in the supervised tier."

    "Questions": [
        "How will the proposed architecture handle gradient conflicts between tiers?",
        "What is the expected computational overhead of the hierarchical architecture?",
        "How will the dynamic gating mechanism be validated empirically?",
        "What are the failure modes of the gradient inversion module?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "Potential gradient conflicts between tiers may degrade performance.",
        "High computational overhead due to multiple tiers and dynamic gating.",
        "Dynamic supervision weighting may not generalize across diverse tasks."
