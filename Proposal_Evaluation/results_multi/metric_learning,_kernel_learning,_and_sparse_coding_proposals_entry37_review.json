    "Summary": "The proposal aims to unify metric learning, kernel learning, and sparse coding into a single framework to address scalability, computational cost, and interpretability limitations. It proposes a three-part framework involving kernelized metric learning, sparse regularization, and efficient optimization, with a comprehensive experiment plan covering synthetic validation, benchmarking, large-scale applications, interpretability analysis, and downstream task transfer.",
