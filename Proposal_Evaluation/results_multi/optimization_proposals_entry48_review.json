    "Summary": "The proposal introduces AdaReg, a framework for adaptive regularization in gradient-based optimization, aiming to improve generalization and convergence speed by dynamically adjusting regularization strength based on gradient statistics and loss landscape geometry. The method integrates with existing optimizers like Adam and includes a comprehensive experiment plan covering synthetic benchmarks, deep learning tasks, and large-scale language modeling.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement.",
        "Compelling hypothesis linking dynamic regularization to improved generalization.",
        "Detailed proposed method with theoretical guarantees.",
