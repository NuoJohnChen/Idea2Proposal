    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a unified framework for deep learning across non-Euclidean geometries using equivariant architectures. It addresses limitations of current GNNs (expressivity, generalization, scalability) by proposing geometry-agnostic equivariant layers, dynamic symmetry adaptation, and hierarchical message passing. The experiment plan includes synthetic tasks, cross-geometry generalization, scalability benchmarks, and real-world applications.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement.",
        "Ambitious and theoretically grounded hypothesis.",
        "Comprehensive proposed method combining multiple innovative components.",
        "Thorough experiment plan covering synthetic tasks, cross-geometry generalization, and real-world applications."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks detailed discussion of computational complexity and feasibility of universal equivariant layers.",
        "Potential challenges in convergence and stability of learnable symmetry detection are not addressed.",
        "Limited discussion of how hierarchical equivariant message passing will scale to very large graphs or complex geometries."
