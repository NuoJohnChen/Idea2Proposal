    "Summary": "The proposal aims to improve machine learning model robustness and generalization under distribution shift by combining invariant representation learning, test-time adaptation, and uncertainty-aware training. It targets both synthetic and real-world benchmarks, with a focus on adversarial robustness and ablation studies.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement backed by relevant literature.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan covering synthetic and real-world benchmarks.",
        "Rigorous validation plan with ablation studies and adversarial robustness testing.",
        "Credible execution plan leveraging established techniques."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Novelty is incremental, building heavily on existing work without a paradigm-shifting insight.",
        "Lacks detail on potential technical challenges (e.g., computational costs, trade-offs).",
        "Validation plan could emphasize failure modes and limitations more."
