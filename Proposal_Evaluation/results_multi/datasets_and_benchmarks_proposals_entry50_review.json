    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a framework for dynamic, diverse, and multi-dimensional machine learning benchmarks to address dataset bias and evaluation gaps. It combines dynamic adversarial construction, multi-dimensional evaluation, and controlled diversity, building on existing methodologies like Dynabench and AdvGLUE.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement with strong motivation.",
        "Comprehensive methodological approach addressing multiple dimensions of benchmark limitations.",
        "Detailed and logically structured experiment plan with clear validation steps."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks transformative novelty; core ideas are incremental improvements over existing work.",
        "Feasibility concerns regarding scalability and practical challenges of continuous adversarial data collection.",
        "Lack of detailed discussion on potential technical hurdles and risks, such as quality control of crowdsourced data or computational costs.",
        "Ethical implications of synthetic data augmentation and crowdsourced adversarial examples are not sufficiently addressed."
