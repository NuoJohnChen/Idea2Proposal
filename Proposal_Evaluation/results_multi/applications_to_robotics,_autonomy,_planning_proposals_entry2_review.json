    "Summary": "The proposal aims to enhance autonomous navigation by integrating uncertainty-aware perception with hierarchical world models. It proposes a three-part framework involving uncertainty-aware perception, hierarchical world modeling, and risk-sensitive planning. The experiment plan includes validation, generalization tests, benchmarking, hardware demonstration, and ablation studies.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement.",
        "Innovative combination of diffusion-based sensor fusion, probabilistic scene graphs, and risk-sensitive planning.",
        "Detailed and comprehensive experiment plan.",
        "Strong grounding in prior work and clear hypothesis.",
        "Includes hardware demonstration for real-world validation."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Feasibility of real-time integration on hardware like Boston Dynamics Spot is unclear.",
        "Computational overhead of uncertainty propagation and hierarchical modeling may limit scalability.",
        "Ablation studies lack specificity on how key components (e.g., uncertainty propagation) will be isolated.",
        "Trade-offs between model complexity and real-time performance are not quantified."

    "Limitations": [
        "High computational overhead may hinder real-time performance.",
        "Scalability in dense, dynamic environments is unproven.",
        "Integration challenges may arise from combining disparate components (e.g., GNNs with MCTS).",
        "Hardware constraints may limit the complexity of the deployed system."
