    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a framework for improving sample efficiency in reinforcement learning (RL) through adaptive model-based priors. It addresses the limitations of current RL methods by dynamically integrating learned priors into the learning process, aiming to enhance exploration and generalization. The experiment plan is comprehensive, covering validation, sample efficiency, generalization, ablation studies, and real-world feasibility.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement.",
        "Compelling hypothesis suggesting the benefits of adaptive model-based priors.",
