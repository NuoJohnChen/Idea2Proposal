Overall Quality: 6
Argumentative Cohesion: 7
Intellectual Depth: 6
Execution Credibility: 5
Scientific Rigor: 6
Decision: Reject
Weaknesses: Insufficient differentiation from existing hybrid approaches in the literature, Lack of technical depth in describing key components (e.g., adaptive resource allocation), Overly ambitious scalability claims without sufficient feasibility analysis, Experimental plan doesn't clearly isolate contributions of different components, Inadequate discussion of computational costs for maintaining population diversity in high dimensions
