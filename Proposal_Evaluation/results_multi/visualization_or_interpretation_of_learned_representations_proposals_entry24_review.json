    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a framework for interpretable neural representations, combining concept-based attribution, latent space factorization, and dynamic visualization to address the opacity of deep neural networks. It aims to jointly optimize fidelity, human-alignment, and modularity, with a detailed experiment plan spanning quantitative metrics, validation, and user studies.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement.",
        "Ambitious hypothesis with a novel angle on joint optimization of interpretability criteria.",
        "Comprehensive and detailed experiment plan.",
        "Leverages existing techniques in a potentially innovative way."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Scalability of NMF to very large models is not thoroughly addressed.",
        "Real-time visualization for high-dimensional data may be impractical.",
        "Lack of discussion on alternative approaches if primary methods fail.",
        "Potential technical challenges are under-explored."
