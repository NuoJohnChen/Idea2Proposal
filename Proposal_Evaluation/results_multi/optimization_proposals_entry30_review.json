    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a framework for adaptive gradient methods that explicitly models and responds to non-stationarity in optimization objectives. It includes a change-point detection module, an adaptive response mechanism, and an efficient implementation plan. The experiments are designed to validate the method across synthetic benchmarks, adversarial shifts, continual learning, and large-scale language modeling.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement.",
        "Compelling hypothesis with potential for significant impact.",
        "Detailed and structured proposed method.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan covering multiple scenarios."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks detailed discussion of potential failure modes and mitigation strategies.",
        "Unclear computational overhead of the change-point detection module.",
        "Limited discussion on how the method scales with model size and complexity."

        "What are the specific thresholds or criteria for triggering the adaptive response mechanisms?",
        "How will the method perform in scenarios with continuous, gradual non-stationarity rather than abrupt changes?"

    "Limitations": [
        "Potential computational overhead from the change-point detection module.",
        "Scalability to very large models is not thoroughly discussed.",
        "The method may introduce additional hyperparameters that need tuning."
