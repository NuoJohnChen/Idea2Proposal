    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a theoretical framework for adaptive learning dynamics in non-convex optimization, addressing the lack of understanding of why certain methods succeed or fail in specific scenarios. It hypothesizes that the success of optimization methods depends on their implicit trajectory geometry and proposes to model optimization as a dynamical system. The method involves trajectory geometry analysis, curvature-adaptive dynamics, and generalization via trajectory analysis. The experiment plan includes synthetic landscapes, deep learning benchmarks, noise resilience analysis, and generalization experiments.",
