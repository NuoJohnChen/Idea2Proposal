Decision: Accept
Weaknesses: Limited discussion of convergence risks with asynchronous gradient updates., Hardware-specific optimizations (e.g., NVLink/Tensor Cores) may not generalize to other architectures., Experiment plan relies heavily on synthetic tasks and a single large-scale dataset (The Pile)., No clear mitigation strategy for potential memory allocator fragmentation issues.
