    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a theoretical framework for adaptive learning dynamics in non-convex optimization, introducing AdaCurv, a novel optimizer leveraging curvature-aware updates and stochastic stability analysis. The work addresses the limitations of current gradient-based methods and includes a comprehensive experiment plan covering synthetic landscapes, deep learning benchmarks, and large-scale language modeling.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and compelling problem statement highlighting gaps in current methods.",
        "Ambitious hypothesis proposing a first-principles derivation of adaptive learning dynamics.",
        "Detailed and comprehensive proposed method with clear steps.",
        "Rigorous experiment plan covering multiple validation scenarios."
