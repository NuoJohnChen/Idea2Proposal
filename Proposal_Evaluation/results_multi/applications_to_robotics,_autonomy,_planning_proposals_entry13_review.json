    "Summary": "The proposal integrates hierarchical planning and adaptive control to enhance robotic autonomy in dynamic environments. It combines temporal logic-based task planners with MCTS for high-level decision-making, MAML for adaptive low-level control, and probabilistic replanning for failure recovery. The experiment plan includes simulation validation, physical robot testing, real-world scenario evaluation, ablation studies, and benchmarking against state-of-the-art methods.",
