    "Summary": "The proposal aims to integrate causal reasoning into neural networks by combining graph-based causal representations with neural architectures. It hypothesizes that explicit modeling of causal structures and intervention-aware training can improve out-of-distribution generalization and counterfactual reasoning. The method involves causal graph integration, intervention-based training, and scalable causal discovery, with experiments planned on synthetic and real-world datasets.",
