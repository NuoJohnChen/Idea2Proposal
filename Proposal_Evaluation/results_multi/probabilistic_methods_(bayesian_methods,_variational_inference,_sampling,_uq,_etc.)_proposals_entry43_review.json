    "Summary": "The proposal seeks to develop a hybrid probabilistic inference framework combining VI, MCMC, and UQ to address scalability and robustness challenges in deep learning. It leverages normalizing flows, adaptive MCMC, and Bayesian deep learning techniques, with a comprehensive experiment plan covering synthetic and real-world datasets.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement highlighting key challenges in Bayesian methods for deep learning.",
        "Ambitious hypothesis proposing a hybrid framework to address scalability and robustness.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan with benchmarks on synthetic and real-world datasets.",
        "Integration of multiple probabilistic techniques (VI, MCMC, UQ) into a unified framework."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks novel insights; heavily builds on prior work without clear theoretical or methodological advancements.",
        "Overly optimistic about scalability, especially for large datasets like ImageNet.",
        "Insufficient discussion of trade-offs between expressiveness and computational tractability.",
        "Limited discussion of potential failure modes and technical challenges."
