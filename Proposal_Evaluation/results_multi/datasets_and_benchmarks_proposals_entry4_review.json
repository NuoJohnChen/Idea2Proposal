    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a three-part framework to address dataset bias and evaluation gaps in machine learning benchmarks: bias-aware dataset construction, dynamic evaluation protocols, and multi-dimensional task design. The goal is to create benchmarks that yield models with stronger out-of-distribution performance and broader applicability.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement with relevant citations.",
        "Compelling motivation and hypothesis linking benchmark design to model robustness and generalizability.",
        "Innovative components in the proposed method (e.g., dynamic evaluation protocols).",
        "Detailed and logically sequenced experiment plan.",
        "Strong focus on real-world applicability and transfer."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Intellectual depth is solid but not paradigm-shifting or field-defining.",
        "Execution credibility is high but could delve deeper into technical challenges like dynamic evaluation scalability.",
        "Scientific rigor is good but could discuss potential pitfalls and alternative approaches more explicitly.",
        "Lack of specificity in metrics for bias quantification and dynamic evaluation implementation.",
        "Potential scalability and reproducibility challenges in dataset construction."

        "How will the collaboration with domain experts be structured to ensure balanced data collection?",
        "What are the expected computational costs and resource requirements for constructing bias-controlled datasets?",
        "How will the multi-dimensional task design balance primary accuracy metrics with auxiliary tasks like explanation generation?"

    "Limitations": [
        "Potential challenges in scaling bias-controlled datasets across diverse domains.",
        "Risk of dynamic evaluation protocols being computationally expensive or difficult to standardize.",
