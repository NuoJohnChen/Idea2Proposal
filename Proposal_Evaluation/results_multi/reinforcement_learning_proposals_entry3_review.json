    "Summary": "The proposal introduces Adaptive Model-Based Priors (AMBP), a framework to improve sample efficiency in RL by dynamically blending model-based and model-free updates using an uncertainty-aware gating mechanism. The method aims to mitigate model errors in MBRL while retaining the robustness of model-free learning. The experiment plan includes validation on synthetic tasks, continuous control, sparse-reward tasks, high-dimensional states, and real-world feasibility studies.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-motivated problem statement.",
        "Innovative combination of uncertainty-aware gating, hybrid learning, and policy distillation.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan covering diverse RL scenarios.",
        "Strong grounding in prior work, with references to key RL literature."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks detailed discussion on computational overhead and scalability challenges.",
        "Uncertainty about the feasibility of joint training for the gating mechanism.",
        "Limited discussion on potential failure modes and risk mitigation strategies.",
        "Execution credibility could be improved with more concrete technical details."

    "Questions": [
        "How will the gating mechanism be trained jointly with the model-free policy without introducing instability?",
        "What are the computational costs of the ensemble-based uncertainty estimates, and how will they scale to high-dimensional states?",
        "What are the potential failure modes of the gating mechanism in highly stochastic environments?",
        "How will the proposed method handle non-stationary environments or adversarial perturbations?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "Potential high computational overhead due to ensemble-based uncertainty estimates.",
        "Scalability challenges in high-dimensional or real-world settings.",
        "Risk of instability in joint training of the gating mechanism and model-free policy."
