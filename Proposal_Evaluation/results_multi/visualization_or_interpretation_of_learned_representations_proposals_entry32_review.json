    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop interpretable neural representations by combining latent space probing, disentanglement metrics, and directional derivatives to visualize and disentangle learned features in deep networks. The method includes a feature disentanglement framework, dynamic visualization via path integrals, and intervention-based interpretation. The experiment plan covers benchmark disentanglement metrics, layer-wise feature visualization, causal intervention studies, scaling to language models, and real-world deployment.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement.",
        "Strong motivation and hypothesis combining multiple advanced techniques.",
        "Innovative proposed method leveraging Beta-VAE, integrated gradients, and causal mediation analysis.",
        "Comprehensive and detailed experiment plan covering various datasets and real-world applications."

    "Weaknesses": [
        "Computational challenges of scaling dynamic visualization and intervention methods to large models (e.g., BERT) are not fully addressed.",
        "Lack of detailed discussion on trade-offs between interpretability and model performance.",
        "Potential redundancy with existing disentanglement metrics (e.g., Mutual Information Gap).",
        "Human validation studies may introduce subjectivity unless rigorously controlled."
