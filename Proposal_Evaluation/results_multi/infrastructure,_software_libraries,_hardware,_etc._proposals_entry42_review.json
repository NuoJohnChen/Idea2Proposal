    "Summary": "The proposal aims to enhance distributed deep learning (DDL) by optimizing communication efficiency and hardware utilization through adaptive gradient compression and hardware-aware task scheduling. It introduces an integrated infrastructure layer with dynamic gradient synchronization, a DL-specific scheduler, and a unified orchestration middleware. The experiment plan includes benchmarking, validation, evaluation, and ablation studies.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement with relevant citations.",
        "Detailed and innovative proposed method with adaptive gradient synchronization and hardware-aware scheduling.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan covering various aspects of the proposed solution.",
        "Strong scientific rigor with planned ablation studies and baseline comparisons."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Novelty of the adaptive gradient compression and hardware-aware scheduling is somewhat incremental, building on existing work.",
        "Overly optimistic claims about near-linear scaling efficiency and energy reduction lack detailed justification.",
        "Limited discussion on potential failure modes and mitigation strategies.",
        "Baseline selection and statistical validation of results could be more explicit."

    "Questions": [
        "How will the dynamic sparsification algorithm handle cases where gradient contributions are not easily measurable via Fisher information?",
        "What are the specific network conditions under which the bandwidth-aware compression scheduler will switch modes, and how will these thresholds be determined?",
        "How will the hardware-aware scheduler handle extreme heterogeneity in hardware configurations?",
        "What are the fallback mechanisms if the proposed RDMA-based communication fails or underperforms?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "Potential challenges in achieving near-linear scaling efficiency with thousands of workers.",
        "Energy reduction claims may be difficult to validate without detailed power measurement methodologies.",
        "The proposed middleware's compatibility with future versions of PyTorch and TensorFlow is uncertain.",
        "Scalability may be limited by network bandwidth and hardware heterogeneity."
