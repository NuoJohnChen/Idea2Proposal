    "Summary": "The proposal seeks to unify metric learning, kernel learning, and sparse coding into a single framework to address their individual limitations in scalability, robustness, and interpretability. It proposes a three-part framework involving joint metric-kernel learning, sparse coding integration, and scalable kernel approximation. The experiment plan includes benchmarking on noisy label scenarios, evaluating sparse interpretability, scalability analysis, downstream task transfer, and ablation studies.",
