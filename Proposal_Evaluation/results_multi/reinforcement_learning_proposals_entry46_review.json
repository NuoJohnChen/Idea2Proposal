    "Summary": "The proposal introduces Adaptive Prior RL (APRL), a framework to improve reinforcement learning sample efficiency by dynamically balancing model-based and model-free components using adaptive priors. It includes uncertainty-calibrated dynamics models, a dynamic reweighting mechanism, and adaptive policy optimization. The experiment plan covers validation, benchmarking, ablation studies, and real-world deployment.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement.",
        "Compelling hypothesis about adaptive model-based priors.",
        "Detailed proposed method integrating advanced techniques like BNNs and dynamic reweighting.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan covering multiple aspects of validation and benchmarking."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks explicit discussion of computational overhead and scalability challenges.",
        "Validation plan could include more diverse baselines and metrics.",
        "Limited discussion on potential failure modes of the dynamic reweighting mechanism."
