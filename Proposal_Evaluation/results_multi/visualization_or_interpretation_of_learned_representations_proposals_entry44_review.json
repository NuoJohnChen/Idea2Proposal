    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a framework for interpreting deep neural network representations by quantifying, visualizing, and disentangling learned features. It combines quantitative metrics, interactive visualization, and cross-model benchmarking to address the opacity of DNN representations.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement highlighting the limitations of existing methods.",
        "Strong motivation with a well-defined hypothesis.",
        "Comprehensive proposed method combining multiple approaches.",
        "Detailed experiment plan with validation steps and user studies.",
        "Strong scientific rigor with thorough validation and ablation studies."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks a clear breakthrough idea; the approach seems incremental.",
        "Feasibility concerns about disentangling features in large-scale models.",
        "Scalability of the proposed visualization tool is unclear.",
        "Lack of discussion on potential technical challenges in implementing the dynamic pruning and interactive visualization."
