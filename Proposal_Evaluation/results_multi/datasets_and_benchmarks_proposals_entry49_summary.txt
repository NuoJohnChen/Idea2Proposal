Weaknesses: Limited technical details on how dynamic evaluation protocols will handle real-time adversarial example generation and model-in-the-loop data collection., Unclear how bias-aware curation will scale to large datasets without introducing new biases., No concrete plan for ensuring the proposed benchmarks gain traction in the research community., Validation plan lacks detailed ablation studies to isolate the impact of individual components.
