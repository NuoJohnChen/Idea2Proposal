    "Summary": "The proposal aims to enhance causal reasoning in AI by integrating structured intervention mechanisms into neural networks. It proposes a three-part framework involving latent causal structure learning, dynamic intervention generation, and a causal-aware neural architecture. The validation plan includes synthetic datasets, high-dimensional data, and real-world applications.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Addresses a critical and timely problem in AI.",
