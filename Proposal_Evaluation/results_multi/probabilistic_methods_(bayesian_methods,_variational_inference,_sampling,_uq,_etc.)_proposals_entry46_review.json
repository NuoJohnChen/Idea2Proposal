    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a unified framework for scalable and robust probabilistic inference by combining flow-based variational inference (VI), scalable Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), and hierarchical uncertainty quantification (UQ). It targets the limitations of current Bayesian methods in deep learning, focusing on scalability, approximation accuracy, and reliable uncertainty quantification. The experiment plan includes benchmarking, scalability testing, UQ evaluation, real-world applications, and ablation studies.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement.",
        "Strong motivation with a well-defined hypothesis.",
