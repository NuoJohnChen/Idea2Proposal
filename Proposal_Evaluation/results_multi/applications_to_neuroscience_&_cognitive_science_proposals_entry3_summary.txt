Decision: Accept
Weaknesses: Feasibility of integrating diverse biological mechanisms into a single model is questionable, Lacks detailed discussion on potential technical challenges (e.g., computational complexity of SNNs, integration of fMRI and single-neuron data), Limited discussion on baseline comparisons or alternative approaches, Scientific rigor could be improved with more detailed ablation studies or stress tests
