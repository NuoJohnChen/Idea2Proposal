Weaknesses: Semantic regularization lacks implementation details (e.g., loss functions, hyperparameters)., Visualization tool differentiation from existing solutions (e.g., TensorFlow Embedding Projector) is unclear., Interpretability-aware training integration (e.g., multi-objective optimization weights) is underspecified., No discussion of computational overhead from added regularization/visualization., Scalability to large models (e.g., ViTs, LLMs) is unaddressed.
