    "Summary": "The proposal aims to bridge the gap between correlation and causation in AI by developing dynamic graph-based models that can infer and adapt causal structures over time. It addresses limitations in current methods, such as static representations and poor generalization to unseen interventions, with a hybrid architecture combining GNNs and attention-based mechanisms. The proposed method includes context-aware causal graph learning, intervention-aware representation learning, and efficient counterfactual simulation. The experiment plan is comprehensive, covering synthetic benchmarks, real-world datasets, high-dimensional data, and computational efficiency.",
