    "Summary": "The proposal aims to bridge the gap between correlation and causation in neural networks by developing scalable, differentiable methods for causal reasoning. It hypothesizes that embedding causal inductive biases into neural architectures can improve robustness and generalization. The method includes differentiable causal discovery, counterfactual-aware training, and scalable causal transfer, with a detailed experiment plan covering validation, robustness, counterfactual evaluation, domain transfer, and ablations.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-motivated problem statement.",
