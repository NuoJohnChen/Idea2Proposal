    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a co-designed infrastructure stack for efficient distributed training of large-scale AI models, addressing communication overhead, memory fragmentation, and hardware-software mismatch. It proposes an adaptive communication engine, memory-centric runtime, and hardware-specific backends, with a detailed experiment plan to validate the approach.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement.",
        "Compelling hypothesis with a co-designed infrastructure stack.",
        "Detailed proposed method with three main components.",
        "Thorough experiment plan covering benchmarking, memory efficiency, hardware testing, scalability, and ablation studies."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks depth in discussing potential technical challenges and risks.",
        "Feasibility of scaling to 1K GPUs could be more thoroughly addressed.",
        "Limited discussion on risk mitigation strategies and real-world deployment scenarios."
