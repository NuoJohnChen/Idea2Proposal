    "Summary": "The proposal introduces dynamic latent structures for generative models to bridge the expressivity-efficiency gap. It hypothesizes that adaptive latent hierarchies can improve model performance by selectively allocating computational resources based on input complexity. The method involves adaptive latent hierarchies, selective computation with Gumbel-Softmax, and a hybrid training objective. The experiment plan includes validation on synthetic data, benchmarking on image generation, testing on long-sequence data, analyzing latent adaptivity, and downstream task transfer.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement identifying limitations in current generative models.",
        "Compelling hypothesis about the benefits of dynamic latent structures.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan covering multiple data modalities."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Method section lacks detail on implementation, particularly the gating network.",
        "Experiment plan is overly optimistic with no discussion of potential pitfalls.",
        "Scientific rigor is questionable; no clear plan for rigorous hypothesis testing.",
        "Lacks discussion of computational overhead introduced by dynamic structures."

    "Limitations": [
        "Potential computational overhead from dynamic structures may offset efficiency gains.",
