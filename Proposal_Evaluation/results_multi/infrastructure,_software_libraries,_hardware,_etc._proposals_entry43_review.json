    "Summary": "The proposal focuses on optimizing distributed training infrastructure for large-scale AI models through a hardware-software co-design approach. It identifies key inefficiencies in current frameworks and proposes solutions involving asynchronous gradient aggregation, memory optimization, and hardware-aware parallelism. The experiment plan includes benchmarking, evaluation, validation, and ablation studies to rigorously test the proposed methods.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement.",
        "Strong motivation and hypothesis grounded in recent literature.",
        "Comprehensive proposed method covering multiple aspects of optimization.",
        "Detailed and rigorous experiment plan with benchmarking, evaluation, and ablation studies."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Limited discussion of convergence risks with asynchronous gradient updates.",
        "Hardware-specific optimizations (e.g., NVLink/Tensor Cores) may not generalize to other architectures.",
        "Experiment plan relies heavily on synthetic tasks and a single large-scale dataset (The Pile).",
        "No clear mitigation strategy for potential memory allocator fragmentation issues."

    "Limitations": [
        "Convergence stability under asynchronous updates is not guaranteed.",
        "Dependence on NVIDIA-specific features limits broader applicability.",
        "Scalability beyond 1024 GPUs is untested.",
