    "Summary": "The proposal seeks to unify metric learning, kernel learning, and sparse coding into a single framework to address scalability, adaptability, and interpretability issues in representation learning. It hypothesizes that a synergistic integration of these methods will outperform disjoint approaches, particularly in tasks like few-shot learning and cross-modal retrieval. The proposed method includes metric-guided kernel learning, sparse kernel bases, and end-to-end optimization, with a comprehensive experiment plan covering synthetic validation, benchmarking, scalability testing, cross-modal retrieval, and ablation studies.",
