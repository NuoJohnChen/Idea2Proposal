    "Summary": "The proposal introduces Dynamic Manifold Generative Models (DMGM) to address the trade-off between sample quality and diversity in generative models. It hypothesizes that dynamic latent manifolds can better capture multi-modal distributions and mitigate mode collapse. The method combines latent manifold learning with adaptive priors, hierarchical latent dynamics, and efficient sampling via differentiable projections. The experimental plan includes validation on synthetic data, standard image datasets, 3D shapes, efficiency analysis, and downstream tasks.",
