Weaknesses: Lacks detailed discussion on potential technical challenges and trade-offs., Feasibility concerns about scaling to high-dimensional domains (10³–10⁵ nodes)., Limited discussion on computational costs of dynamic graph updates and identifiability constraints., No preliminary results or concrete examples to demonstrate feasibility., Trade-offs between interpretability and scalability are not thoroughly explored., Validation plan could benefit from more explicit discussion of baseline comparisons and failure modes.
