    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a next-generation distributed training framework to address inefficiencies in current systems, focusing on topology-aware communication scheduling, memory-efficient state management, and a unified hardware abstraction layer. The goal is to improve scalability and efficiency for large-scale AI workloads.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement.",
        "Strong motivation with a hypothesis grounded in existing literature.",
        "Detailed and feasible experiment plan with clear benchmarks.",
        "Comprehensive validation strategy including end-to-end scaling studies."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Limited novelty as the approach builds heavily on existing work.",
        "Lacks discussion on potential challenges in integrating diverse hardware backends.",
        "Could benefit from more critical analysis of potential failure modes."
