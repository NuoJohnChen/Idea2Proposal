    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a hybrid approach combining Hierarchical Task Networks (HTNs) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to enhance multi-agent planning under uncertainty. It targets applications in collaborative robotics, search-and-rescue, and warehouse automation. The method involves hierarchical task decomposition, uncertainty-aware DRL, and bidirectional plan-policy communication. The experiment plan includes benchmarking, validation, and real-world deployment.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement highlighting the limitations of existing methods.",
        "Plausible hypothesis that integrates HTNs and DRL to leverage their respective strengths.",
        "Detailed proposed method with specific components like hierarchical task decomposition and uncertainty-aware DRL.",
