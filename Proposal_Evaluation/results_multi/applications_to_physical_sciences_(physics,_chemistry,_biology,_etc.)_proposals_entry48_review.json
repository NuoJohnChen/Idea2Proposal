    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a hybrid neural operator framework for accelerating multiscale simulations in physical sciences by combining neural operators with multiscale physical priors. It addresses the limitations of current methods in terms of computational efficiency, generalizability, and interpretability through a three-part framework involving multiscale kernel learning, a hybrid numerical-ML solver, and interpretable latent dynamics. The proposed method is validated on canonical PDEs, molecular dynamics, and real-world problems.",
