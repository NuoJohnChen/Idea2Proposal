    "Summary": "The proposal aims to bridge the gap between theoretical generalization bounds and empirical performance in machine learning by developing a unified framework that incorporates optimization-aware generalization bounds and systematic robustness evaluation. The approach includes theoretical foundations, robust training paradigms, and a comprehensive evaluation benchmark.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Addresses a critical and timely issue in machine learning.",
        "Well-articulated problem statement and motivation grounded in recent literature.",
        "Ambitious hypothesis aiming to bridge theory and practice.",
        "Comprehensive proposed method combining theoretical analysis, robust training, and benchmark development.",
        "Detailed experiment plan including theoretical validation, robust training, benchmark development, scaling, and ablation studies."
