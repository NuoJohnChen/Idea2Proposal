    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a unified framework for visualizing and interpreting learned representations in deep neural networks (DNNs) by combining disentangled representation analysis, dynamic feature attribution, and cross-modal alignment. It seeks to address the opacity of DNNs through systematic, scalable, and quantitative tools, validated via rigorous metrics and human evaluations.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement.",
        "Strong motivation and hypothesis grounded in prior work.",
        "Ambitious and comprehensive proposed method combining multiple techniques.",
        "Detailed and structured experiment plan, including benchmarking, validation, and real-world deployment.",
        "High scientific rigor with planned benchmarks and validations."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lack of detail on how the three components will interact in a unified framework.",
        "Ambiguity around scalability to very large models like GPT-3.",
        "Insufficient discussion of potential pitfalls, alternative approaches, and risk mitigation strategies.",
        "Execution credibility is somewhat undermined by the ambitious scope.",
        "Reliance on human evaluations may introduce subjectivity and practical challenges."
