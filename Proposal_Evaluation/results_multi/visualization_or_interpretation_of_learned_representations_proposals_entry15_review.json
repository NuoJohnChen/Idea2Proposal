    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a unified framework for interpretable representation learning in deep neural networks by combining unsupervised disentanglement with concept-based visualization. The method includes latent slot attention for disentanglement, generative models for visualization, and a quantitative evaluation framework. The experiment plan spans synthetic data, vision models, language models, and real-world utility assessments.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement.",
