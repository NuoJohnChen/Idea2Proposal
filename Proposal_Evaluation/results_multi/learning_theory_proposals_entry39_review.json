    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a theoretical framework for adaptive learning dynamics in non-convex optimization, addressing the limitations of gradient descent in deep learning. It hypothesizes that learning dynamics should adapt to local geometry and proposes a method with dynamic learning rate modulation, Hessian-aware escape mechanisms, and adaptive noise injection. The experiment plan includes theoretical analysis, benchmarking, and applications in deep networks.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement.",
        "Ambitious and original hypothesis with potential for broad impact.",
        "Detailed and theoretically grounded proposed method.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan covering theoretical and practical aspects."

    "Weaknesses": [
        "Feasibility of Hessian approximations in large-scale models is not thoroughly discussed.",
        "Potential computational overhead is not fully addressed.",
        "Lack of discussion on the trade-offs between theoretical guarantees and practical implementation."
