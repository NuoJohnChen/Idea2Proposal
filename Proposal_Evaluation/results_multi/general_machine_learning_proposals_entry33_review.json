    "Summary": "The proposal aims to improve machine learning model robustness under distribution shifts by combining invariant risk minimization (IRM) with self-supervised learning (SSL) and dynamic domain augmentation. It targets the limitation of current methods like ERM and domain adaptation, proposing a unified framework for out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement motivated by real-world limitations of current ML methods.",
        "Novel integration of IRM, SSL, and dynamic domain augmentation.",
        "Comprehensive experimental plan with multiple benchmarks and real-world deployment evaluation.",
        "Strong grounding in recent literature (e.g., Arjovsky et al., 2019; Koh et al., 2021)."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks technical specifics on how spurious features will be perturbed for domain augmentation.",
        "Potential underestimation of computational challenges in integrating IRM and SSL.",
        "Limited discussion of ablation studies to isolate contributions of each proposed component.",
        "Real-world deployment evaluation is ambitious and may face unforeseen practical hurdles."

        "Will there be ablation studies to isolate the contributions of IRM, SSL, and domain augmentation?",
        "How will the proposed method scale to very high-dimensional data (e.g., video or multimodal inputs)?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "Integration of IRM and SSL may introduce unforeseen technical challenges.",
        "Dynamic domain augmentation relies on identifying spurious features, which may not always be straightforward.",
        "Real-world deployment may reveal additional distribution shifts not covered in training."
