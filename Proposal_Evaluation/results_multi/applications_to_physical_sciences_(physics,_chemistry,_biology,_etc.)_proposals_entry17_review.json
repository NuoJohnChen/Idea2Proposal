    "Summary": "The proposal introduces neural operators with multiscale architectures and symmetry priors to accelerate the simulation of multiscale physical systems. It aims to overcome the limitations of traditional numerical methods and current machine learning-based surrogate models by generalizing across varying boundary conditions, domain geometries, and parameter regimes. The proposed method includes hierarchical attention mechanisms, physics-guided training, and operator compression. The experiment plan covers canonical PDEs, novel domains, multiscale validation, real-world applications, and ablation studies.",
