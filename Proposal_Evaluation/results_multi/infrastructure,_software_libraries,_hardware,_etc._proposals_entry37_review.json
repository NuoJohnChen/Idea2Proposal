    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a scalable infrastructure for heterogeneous AI workloads by introducing a hardware-virtualization layer that decouples AI frameworks from physical devices. The solution includes a dynamic hardware scheduler, a unified intermediate representation (IR) for hardware targets, and zero-copy data sharing. The experiment plan covers benchmarking, scheduler validation, IR compatibility, multi-tenancy scalability, and real-world deployment.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-structured problem statement and motivation.",
        "Ambitious and potentially impactful solution addressing a timely problem.",
        "Detailed experiment plan covering a broad range of scenarios.",
        "Strong scientific rigor with comprehensive validation metrics."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Feasibility concerns regarding the integration of diverse components (RL-based scheduler, unified IR, RDMA).",
        "Lack of detailed discussion on potential technical challenges and risk mitigation strategies.",
        "Optimistic claims (e.g., 20\u201340% latency reduction) without preliminary results.",
        "Execution credibility could be improved with more concrete technical details."
