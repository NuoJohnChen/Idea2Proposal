    "Summary": "The proposal introduces Adaptive Prior RL (APRL), a novel framework combining uncertainty-aware model priors, hybrid policy optimization, and task-aware meta-learning to improve RL sample efficiency and robustness. It dynamically adjusts the influence of learned models based on their accuracy and uncertainty, leveraging both model-based and model-free updates.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and compelling problem statement highlighting the limitations of current RL methods.",
        "Innovative hypothesis proposing adaptive priors to dynamically adjust model influence.",
        "Well-structured experiment plan with a progression from toy environments to real-world feasibility studies.",
        "Integration of uncertainty-aware models and meta-learning for generalization across tasks."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks detailed mechanisms for learning the confidence score and interpolation weights.",
        "Experiment plan could benefit from more rigorous baselines and ablation studies.",
        "Limited discussion on potential technical challenges and risks in scaling to high-dimensional settings.",
        "No explicit mention of how the proposed method will handle catastrophic model failures."

    "Questions": [
        "How exactly will the confidence score be learned and integrated into the policy updates?",
        "What are the specific mechanisms for determining the interpolation weights between model-based and model-free updates?",
        "How will the method handle catastrophic model failures or extreme uncertainty?",
        "What are the computational overheads of the proposed adaptive prior mechanism?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "Potential scalability issues in high-dimensional state spaces.",
        "Risk of over-reliance on the model in regions where it is not sufficiently accurate.",
        "Generalization to entirely unseen tasks may be limited by the meta-learning approach."
