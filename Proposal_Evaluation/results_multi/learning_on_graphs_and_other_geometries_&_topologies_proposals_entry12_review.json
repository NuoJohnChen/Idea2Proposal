    "Summary": "The proposal aims to extend deep learning to non-Euclidean domains by unifying geometric priors with neural architectures, addressing limitations of current graph neural networks (GNNs) in expressivity, scalability, and generalization. The proposed method includes unified geometric architectures, scalable learning on dynamic graphs, and theoretical foundations. The experiment plan is comprehensive, covering validation, scalability benchmarks, generalization tests, ablation studies, and theoretical analysis.",
