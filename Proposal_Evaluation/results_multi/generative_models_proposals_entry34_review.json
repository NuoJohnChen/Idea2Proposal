    "Summary": "The proposal aims to enhance generative models by introducing dynamic latent structures to improve expressivity and efficiency. It targets limitations in current models like diffusion models and VAEs, proposing dynamic hierarchical VAEs, adaptive diffusion scheduling, and cross-modal latent alignment.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement highlighting limitations of current generative models.",
        "Ambitious and novel hypothesis about dynamic latent structures.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan covering synthetic data, benchmarks, and ablation studies."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lack of detailed technical implementation for dynamic hierarchies and adaptive diffusion scheduling.",
        "Generic experiment plan without addressing specific technical challenges.",
        "Unclear how computational overhead and training stability will be managed."
