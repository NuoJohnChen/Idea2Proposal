    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a biologically plausible spiking neural network (SNN) model to bridge computational models and cognitive neuroscience in understanding decision-making. It hypothesizes that a biologically constrained SNN incorporating cortico-striatal loops and dopamine-dependent plasticity can better explain neural activity and behavioral variability. The proposed method includes model development, behavioral validation, neural predictions, and ablation studies.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement highlighting the gap between computational models and neuroimaging studies.",
        "Ambitious hypothesis proposing a unified framework for decision-making.",
        "Detailed and structured experimental plan with clear steps for model development and validation.",
        "Planned comparisons to existing models and ablation studies demonstrate scientific rigor."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Feasibility of integrating complex neural dynamics into a single model is highly challenging and not thoroughly discussed.",
        "Lack of discussion on potential technical hurdles, such as computational complexity of SNNs or interpretability of simulated fMRI signals.",
        "Experimental plan may be overly optimistic given the scope and complexity of the proposed work.",
        "Limited critical discussion on limitations and alternative approaches."
