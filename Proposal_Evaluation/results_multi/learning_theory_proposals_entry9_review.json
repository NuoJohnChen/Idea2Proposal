    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a theoretical framework and algorithm (AEMN) for adaptive learning dynamics in non-convex optimization, inspired by biological systems and statistical physics. It aims to provably escape poor local minima, improve performance on non-convex benchmarks, and scale efficiently. The experimental plan includes synthetic benchmarks, neural network validation, theoretical analysis, large-scale scaling, and biological plausibility studies.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-motivated problem statement.",
        "Innovative hypothesis drawing from interdisciplinary insights.",
        "Comprehensive proposed method combining theory and practice.",
        "Detailed experimental plan with synthetic and neural network benchmarks.",
        "Strong theoretical foundation with potential for significant impact."

    "Weaknesses": [
        "Overly ambitious execution plan, especially large-scale and biological plausibility components.",
        "Feasibility of theoretical claims (e.g., convergence proofs) is uncertain.",
        "Experimental plan could be more focused on core claims.",
        "Potential computational overhead may limit practical applicability.",
        "Lack of preliminary results to support high-risk theoretical claims."
