    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a theoretical framework for adaptive learning dynamics in non-convex optimization, bridging the gap between empirical success and theoretical understanding. It combines SDE formulation, Lyapunov-based convergence analysis, and empirical validation on synthetic and real-world datasets.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement.",
        "Compelling hypothesis grounded in prior work.",
        "Ambitious and comprehensive methodology combining theory and experiments.",
        "Detailed and feasible step-by-step experiment plan.",
        "Potential to significantly advance theoretical understanding of adaptive optimization methods."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Feasibility of deriving rigorous SDE-based convergence guarantees is uncertain.",
        "Scalability to deep networks, especially regarding computational costs of Hessian-vector products.",
        "Generalizability of synthetic landscapes to real-world problems is not thoroughly addressed.",
        "Lacks discussion of potential pitfalls in scaling the SDE model to deep networks."

    "Questions": [
        "How will the SDE model account for higher-order terms not captured by gradient and Hessian information?",
        "What are the specific metrics for 'width' of minima, and how will they be quantified?",
        "How will the proposal handle cases where the SDE approximation fails to predict optimizer behavior?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "Theoretical insights may not scale to very deep networks due to computational constraints.",
        "Synthetic landscapes may not fully represent the complexity of real-world optimization problems.",
        "The SDE formulation may oversimplify the dynamics of adaptive methods in practice."
