    "Summary": "The proposal introduces a hybrid optimization method that dynamically switches between zeroth- and first-order updates based on local smoothness estimates, aiming to address non-smooth objectives in machine learning. It includes a three-part framework: smoothness estimation, dynamic updates, and theoretical guarantees, with a comprehensive experiment plan.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement highlighting limitations of existing methods.",
        "Novel hypothesis combining zeroth- and first-order methods.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan covering synthetic benchmarks, RL tasks, and adversarial training.",
        "Potential for broad impact in areas like reinforcement learning and adversarial training."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lacks detailed technical specifics on smoothness estimation and dynamic switching.",
        "Experiment plan is generic and lacks depth in addressing potential pitfalls.",
        "Theoretical guarantees are mentioned but not substantiated with preliminary results or proofs.",
        "Feasibility concerns due to insufficient detail on implementation and computational overhead."
