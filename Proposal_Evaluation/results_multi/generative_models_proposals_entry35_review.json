    "Summary": "The proposal introduces dynamic latent manifolds (DLMs) to improve generative models by enabling adaptive latent representations that balance sample quality, diversity, and computational efficiency. The method combines normalizing flows, attention mechanisms, and reinforcement learning, with a comprehensive experiment plan to validate the approach.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement.",
        "Innovative hypothesis with strong theoretical grounding.",
        "Comprehensive and detailed experiment plan.",
        "Novel combination of techniques (normalizing flows, attention, RL).",
        "Strong benchmarks and metrics for validation."
