    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a hybrid computational model of dynamic attention, integrating predictive coding and reinforcement learning, and validate it with multimodal imaging and clinical applications in ADHD and schizophrenia. It combines theoretical modeling, neural validation, and clinical translation.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Novel and ambitious interdisciplinary approach integrating computational modeling and cognitive neuroscience.",
        "Clear problem statement and well-motivated hypothesis focusing on theta-gamma PAC and dopaminergic signals.",
        "Comprehensive validation plan involving synthetic tasks, healthy adults, and clinical populations.",
        "Potential for significant impact in both theoretical and clinical domains."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Feasibility concerns, particularly in clinical validation and therapeutic intervention steps.",
        "Lack of detailed technical specifics on hybrid model implementation and validation.",
        "Overly optimistic clinical translation given the complexity of ADHD and schizophrenia.",
        "Experimental plan could benefit from more detailed ablation studies and stronger baselines."
