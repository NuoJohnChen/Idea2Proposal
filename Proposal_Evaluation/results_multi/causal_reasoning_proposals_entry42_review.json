    "Summary": "The proposal aims to bridge the gap between correlation and causation in neural networks by integrating causal graphs into neural architectures. It proposes a causal latent space design using a VAE framework, intervention-efficient learning via self-supervision, and scalable causal inference with transformers. The experiment plan includes validation on synthetic and real-world datasets, efficiency analysis, and human-in-the-loop evaluation.",
