    "Summary": "The proposal seeks to unify metric learning, kernel learning, and sparse coding into a single framework to address their individual limitations. It proposes adaptive kernel metric learning, sparse kernel regularization, and end-to-end optimization, with a comprehensive experiment plan covering synthetic data, benchmarking, kernel adaptability, sparse interpretability, and real-world deployment.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Ambitious and novel idea combining three powerful paradigms.",
        "Well-articulated problem statement identifying key challenges.",
