    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a unified framework for multimodal representation learning that bridges vision, audio, and language modalities. It identifies limitations in current methods, such as reliance on large-scale paired datasets and inefficiencies in aligning heterogeneous modalities. The proposed solution combines cross-modal masked modeling, dynamic modality alignment, and a lightweight adapter architecture to learn robust, modality-agnostic representations. The experiment plan includes validation of cross-modal masking, testing dynamic alignment, benchmarking adapter efficiency, downstream generalization, and ablation studies.",
