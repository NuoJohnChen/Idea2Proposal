    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a unified framework for neurosymbolic AI, combining differentiable logic, physics-informed learning, and formal verification to address the limitations of current AI systems in integrating neural networks with symbolic reasoning. The method involves three parts: differentiable logic and constraint integration, hybrid learning and reasoning pipelines, and formal verification. The experiment plan includes benchmarking constraint integration methods, evaluating hybrid reasoning pipelines, assessing generalization, verifying robustness, and real-world deployment.",
