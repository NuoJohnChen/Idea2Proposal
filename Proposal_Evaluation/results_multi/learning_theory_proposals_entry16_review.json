    "Summary": "The proposal aims to develop a theoretical framework for adaptive learning dynamics in non-convex optimization, focusing on why adaptive methods like Adam outperform gradient descent. It combines SDE approximations, dynamical systems theory, and PAC-Bayes analysis to formalize implicit curvature exploitation and generalization behavior. The experiment plan includes synthetic tasks, controlled experiments, and real-world benchmarks.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement identifying a significant gap in current theory.",
        "Ambitious hypothesis with potential for high impact if proven.",
        "Theoretical rigor in proposed methods, leveraging advanced mathematical tools.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan covering synthetic, controlled, and real-world scenarios."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Lack of detailed discussion on potential technical challenges (e.g., complexity of SDE derivation, computational costs of Hessian spectra tracking).",
        "Execution credibility could be improved with more risk mitigation strategies.",
        "Limited discussion on how to handle cases where the SDE approximation might fail.",
        "Scalability of experiments, especially with Transformers, could be challenging."

        "How will you validate the assumptions underlying your PAC-Bayes analysis?",
        "What alternative approaches will you consider if the primary hypotheses are not supported by experiments?"

    "Limitations": [
        "Theoretical derivations might be highly complex and difficult to validate empirically.",
        "Computational costs of Hessian spectra tracking could limit scalability.",
        "The SDE approximation might not fully capture the discrete dynamics of adaptive methods.",
        "The proposed framework may not generalize to all non-convex optimization scenarios."
