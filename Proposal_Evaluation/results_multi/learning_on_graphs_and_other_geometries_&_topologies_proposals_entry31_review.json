    "Summary": "The proposal introduces Geometric Neural Operators (GNOs), a unified framework for deep learning on non-Euclidean domains by incorporating geometric and topological priors. It addresses limitations in expressive power, scalability, and geometric awareness of current GNNs through curvature-adaptive architectures, topological regularization, and scalable computation methods.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear and well-articulated problem statement identifying key gaps in current GNNs.",
        "Ambitious hypothesis proposing a unified framework integrating diverse mathematical tools.",
        "Detailed proposed method with three distinct components addressing different limitations.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan covering synthetic benchmarks, real-world tasks, and scalability analysis."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Limited discussion on potential technical challenges and risks.",
        "Feasibility concerns due to the complexity of integrating differential geometry, sheaf theory, and persistent homology.",
        "Experiment plan may be overly ambitious given the scope and complexity of the proposed method."

    "Limitations": [
        "Potential computational overhead from integrating geometric and topological priors.",
        "Reliance on accurate geometric and topological priors, which may not always be available.",
