  "Summary": "The proposal introduces SimpleResUNet, a lightweight image classification network combining ResNet, U-Net, and attention mechanisms. It aims to address limitations in current lightweight models by improving feature richness and computational efficiency, particularly for small datasets. The proposal includes a clear problem statement and a comprehensive experimental plan but lacks significant novelty and specificity in critical areas.",
  "Strengths": [
    "Clear problem statement identifying gaps in current lightweight models.",
    "Comprehensive experimental plan covering multiple validation aspects.",
    "Plausible hypothesis integrating multi-scale feature fusion and attention mechanisms.",
    "Focus on practical deployment, including edge device testing."
  ],
  "Weaknesses": [
    "Lack of sufficient novelty justification; similar hybrid architectures exist.",
    "Vague description of the attention mechanism redesign.",
    "Experimental plan lacks specificity in some areas (e.g., adversarial attack simulation).",
    "Limited discussion of potential failure modes or alternative approaches.",
    "Overly ambitious execution plan risks dilution of focus."

  "Questions": [
    "How does SimpleResUNet differ significantly from existing hybrid architectures like Res-UNet or TransUNet?",
    "What specific advantages does the proposed attention mechanism offer over existing methods?",
    "Which sub-experiments are most critical to validating the core hypothesis?",
    "How will the model handle cases where the attention mechanism fails to identify discriminative features?"
  ],
  "Limitations": [
    "Potential over-reliance on small-sample datasets, which may not generalize to larger datasets.",
    "Complexity of the hybrid architecture may still pose challenges for extremely resource-constrained environments.",
    "Risk of marginal improvements that don't justify the added complexity.",
    "Unclear scalability of the proposed method to larger datasets."
