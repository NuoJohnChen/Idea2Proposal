1. Title:
**Towards Robust and Scalable Benchmarks: Addressing Dataset Bias and Evaluation Gaps in Machine Learning**
2. Problem Statement:
Current machine learning benchmarks often suffer from dataset bias, lack of diversity, and evaluation protocols that do not reflect real-world deployment scenarios. For instance, widely used datasets like ImageNet and GLUE have been shown to contain annotation artifacts, spurious correlations, and limited coverage of edge cases, leading to overestimated model performance (Gururangan et al., 2018; Recht et al., 2019). Additionally, benchmarks frequently fail to account for computational efficiency, fairness, and robustness to distribution shifts, creating a disconnect between research progress and practical applicability. There is a pressing need for benchmarks that are both rigorous (statistically sound) and representative (diverse and scalable).
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the current limitations in benchmarks stem from three key issues: (1) static datasets that do not evolve with model capabilities, (2) evaluation metrics that prioritize narrow task performance over generalizability, and (3) insufficient emphasis on computational and ethical constraints. For example, recent work by Koh et al. (2021) demonstrates that models trained on static benchmarks often fail to generalize to dynamic real-world data.
Our central idea is to design a benchmark framework that addresses these gaps by:
- **Dynamic Dataset Curation**: Automatically updating datasets to include challenging edge cases and distribution shifts.
- **Multi-Dimensional Evaluation**: Incorporating metrics for robustness, fairness, and efficiency alongside accuracy.
- **Scalability**: Supporting large-scale, real-time benchmarking to keep pace with model advancements.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a three-part methodology to develop next-generation benchmarks:
(1) **Dynamic Dataset Construction**:
- Leverage techniques from dataset distillation (Sucholutsky & Schonlau, 2021) and adversarial example generation (Madry et al., 2018) to create datasets that evolve with model improvements.
- Use synthetic data augmentation to cover rare but critical scenarios (e.g., low-resource languages or medical imaging anomalies).
(2) **Unified Evaluation Framework**:
- Integrate robustness metrics like out-of-distribution (OOD) accuracy (Hendrycks & Dietterich, 2019) and fairness measures (e.g., demographic parity).
- Develop a standardized protocol for measuring computational costs (e.g., FLOPs, memory usage) alongside task performance.
(3) **Scalable Benchmark Infrastructure**:
- Build a cloud-based platform for real-time benchmarking, inspired by the Dynabench framework (Kiela et al., 2021).
- Enable community-driven dataset updates via crowdsourcing and expert review.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Identify Benchmark Limitations**:
- Conduct a meta-analysis of existing datasets (e.g., WILDS (Koh et al., 2021), BELEBELE (Muennighoff et al., 2023)) to quantify bias and coverage gaps.
- Use ai_researcher_search to compile failure modes reported in literature (e.g., annotation artifacts in SQuAD).
2. **Pilot Dynamic Dataset Construction**:
- Generate adversarial variants of CIFAR-10 and IMDB reviews using TextAttack (Morris et al., 2020) and RobustBench (Croce et al., 2021).
- Evaluate model performance drop on these variants to validate dataset difficulty.
3. **Develop Multi-Dimensional Metrics**:
- Extend existing metrics (e.g., accuracy) with robustness (OOD AUC) and fairness (subgroup disparity).
- Benchmark 5-10 SOTA models (e.g., GPT-4, ResNet) to establish baselines.
4. **Deploy Scalable Infrastructure**:
- Prototype a cloud-based benchmark platform using Kubernetes for distributed evaluation.
- Test scalability by evaluating 100+ models concurrently on dynamically generated tasks.
5. **Community Validation**:
- Release the benchmark framework to the research community for feedback.
- Collaborate with MLPerf (Reddi et al., 2020) and Hugging Face to integrate into existing workflows.

1. Title:
Towards Robust and Scalable Benchmarks: Addressing Dataset Biases and Evaluation Gaps in Machine Learning
2. Problem Statement:
Current machine learning benchmarks often suffer from hidden biases, dataset contamination, and evaluation protocols that fail to capture real-world generalization. For instance, widely used datasets like ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009) and GLUE (Wang et al., 2018) have been shown to contain annotation artifacts (Gururangan et al., 2018) or distributional shifts that skew model performance (Recht et al., 2019). Additionally, benchmark tasks frequently prioritize narrow metrics (e.g., top-1 accuracy) over robustness, fairness, or computational efficiency. This creates a misalignment between research progress and practical deployment needs.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that systematic biases in dataset construction and evaluation protocols lead to inflated performance estimates and hinder reproducible progress. For example, recent work by Bender et al. (2021) highlights how benchmark contamination in language models can artificially boost results. We argue that a rigorous, multi-dimensional benchmarking framework—incorporating adversarial testing, out-of-distribution splits, and efficiency-aware metrics—can better reflect real-world model capabilities. Our central idea is that by (1) auditing existing datasets for biases, (2) designing controlled data splits, and (3) introducing task-specific robustness checks, we can create more reliable benchmarks.
4. Proposed Method:
(1) Dataset Auditing and Decontamination:
We will develop automated tools to detect annotation artifacts (e.g., using n-gram analysis for text or label leakage for images) and propose cleaned versions of popular benchmarks. Inspired by the work of Paullada et al. (2021) on data quality, we will quantify bias sources (e.g., spurious correlations) and release corrected subsets.
(2) Dynamic Benchmark Design:
To address distributional shifts, we will introduce "living benchmarks" with rolling evaluation splits, similar to WILDS (Koh et al., 2021). This involves curating test sets that evolve over time to reflect emerging challenges (e.g., new linguistic phenomena or visual domains).
(3) Multi-Dimensional Evaluation:
We will extend metrics beyond accuracy to include robustness (via adversarial perturbations), fairness (disaggregated performance across subgroups), and efficiency (FLOPs vs. performance trade-offs). This builds on the checklist approach of Ribeiro et al. (2020) for NLP and the robustness libraries of Taori et al. (2020) for vision.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. Audit Existing Benchmarks:
• Replicate bias analyses for GLUE (e.g., label leakage in MNLI) and ImageNet (e.g., background biases).
• Release "clean" subsets with documented artifacts, following the methodology of Gururangan et al. (2018).
2. Construct Dynamic Evaluation Splits:
• Collaborate with domain experts to identify temporal shifts (e.g., COVID-19 imagery in medical datasets).
• Implement a WILDS-like framework for periodic updates, ensuring backward compatibility.
3. Adversarial Testing:
• Generate perturbed test sets using TextAttack (Morris et al., 2020) for NLP and AutoAttack (Croce & Hein, 2020) for vision.
• Measure performance drops to quantify robustness gaps.
4. Efficiency-Aware Benchmarking:
• Profile model FLOPs, memory usage, and latency across hardware (GPUs/TPUs).
• Propose Pareto-optimal efficiency curves, as in the work of Tan & Le (2019) on EfficientNet.
5. Community Validation:
• Organize an open challenge using our benchmark framework, inviting submissions from leading labs.
• Compare results against traditional benchmarks to highlight discrepancies, similar to the findings of Recht et al. (2019).

1. Title:
**Benchmarking Beyond Scale: A Framework for Evaluating Dataset Quality and Model Generalization in the Era of Large-Scale Pretraining**
2. Problem Statement:
Current benchmarks for evaluating machine learning models heavily emphasize scale—both in terms of dataset size and model parameters—while neglecting critical dimensions of dataset quality, diversity, and real-world applicability. Widely used benchmarks like GLUE, SuperGLUE, and ImageNet suffer from saturation effects, where models achieve near-human performance without demonstrating true generalization (Wang et al., 2019; Kiela et al., 2021). Additionally, datasets often contain biases, artifacts, or distributional mismatches that go undetected during evaluation (Torralba & Efros, 2011; Bender et al., 2021). There is a pressing need for a new generation of benchmarks that systematically measure robustness, fairness, and adaptability across diverse domains, rather than relying solely on aggregate metrics like accuracy or perplexity.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that current benchmarking practices overemphasize narrow task-specific performance and fail to capture the nuanced capabilities required for real-world deployment. For instance, models may exploit spurious correlations in datasets (Geirhos et al., 2020) or rely on superficial patterns rather than learning underlying reasoning (McCoy et al., 2019). Our central idea is that a benchmark’s utility should be measured not just by its difficulty but by its ability to surface model weaknesses and encourage the development of more generalizable systems.
We propose that a high-quality benchmark must:
- **Measure Robustness**: Include adversarial or distribution-shifted variants to test invariance (Hendrycks & Dietterich, 2019).
- **Prioritize Diversity**: Span multiple modalities (text, vision, audio) and cultural contexts (Rudinger et al., 2018).
- **Encounter Novelty**: Incorporate dynamic or evolving tasks to prevent overfitting to static evaluation sets (Liang et al., 2022).
4. Proposed Method:
We will develop a benchmarking framework that evaluates models along three axes:
(1) **Dataset Quality Auditing**:
- Introduce a suite of metrics to quantify dataset artifacts, such as label leakage, duplication, and bias (Paullada et al., 2021).
- Leverage techniques like influence functions (Koh & Liang, 2017) to identify samples that disproportionately affect model performance.
(2) **Generalization Testing**:
- Design "stress tests" that perturb inputs (e.g., paraphrasing, noise injection) to measure robustness (Gardner et al., 2020).
- Incorporate out-of-distribution (OOD) evaluation splits, including data from underrepresented languages or domains (Joshi et al., 2020).
(3) **Dynamic Benchmarking**:
- Develop a platform for crowdsourced, evolving benchmarks where tasks are periodically updated to reflect real-world shifts (Zellers et al., 2019).
- Use meta-evaluation to assess whether benchmarks themselves are predictive of downstream utility (Ethayarajh & Jurafsky, 2021).
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Audit Existing Benchmarks**:
- Apply quality metrics to 10+ popular datasets (e.g., SQuAD, COCO) to quantify artifacts.
- Publish a "health report" for each dataset, highlighting biases and limitations.
2. **Design Stress Tests**:
- For text: Introduce adversarial paraphrases using back-translation and synonym substitution.
- For vision: Test against natural corruptions (e.g., fog, motion blur) and synthetic perturbations.
3. **Evaluate Model Generalization**:
- Train 5 state-of-the-art models (e.g., GPT-4, CLIP) on standard benchmarks and our stress tests.
- Measure performance gaps to identify overestimation of capabilities.
4. **Deploy Dynamic Benchmark**:
- Collaborate with ML communities to crowdsource new tasks quarterly.
- Track how model performance degrades over time as tasks evolve.
5. **Meta-Evaluation**:
- Correlate benchmark performance with real-world deployment outcomes (e.g., API errors, user feedback).
- Publish guidelines for creating future benchmarks that avoid common pitfalls.

**Towards Robust and Scalable Benchmarks: Addressing Dataset Bias and Evaluation Gaps in Machine Learning**
2. Problem Statement:
Current machine learning benchmarks often suffer from dataset bias, lack of diversity, and evaluation protocols that fail to capture real-world generalization. For instance, widely used datasets like ImageNet and GLUE exhibit biases in data collection (e.g., geographic and demographic skews) and task design (e.g., narrow linguistic diversity) [1, 2]. Additionally, benchmarks frequently prioritize leaderboard performance over robustness, leading to models that overfit to specific evaluation splits without meaningful improvements in real-world applicability [3]. There is a critical need for benchmarks that systematically address these limitations while maintaining scalability and reproducibility.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that current benchmarking practices inadvertently incentivize short-term optimization over long-term progress. For example, models trained on biased datasets may achieve high accuracy on held-out test sets but fail under distribution shifts or adversarial conditions [4]. Our central idea is that a benchmark’s design—including dataset composition, evaluation metrics, and task diversity—directly influences the robustness and generalizability of models developed for it. We propose that a benchmark incorporating (1) controlled bias mitigation, (2) dynamic evaluation protocols, and (3) multi-dimensional task design will yield models with stronger out-of-distribution performance and broader applicability.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a three-part framework for developing next-generation benchmarks:
(1) **Bias-Aware Dataset Construction**:
We will design datasets with explicit controls for geographic, demographic, and linguistic diversity. For vision tasks, we will leverage stratified sampling across underrepresented regions (e.g., DollarStreet for geographic diversity [5]). For NLP, we will incorporate code-switched and low-resource language data [6].
(2) **Dynamic Evaluation Protocols**:
Static test sets are prone to overfitting. We will introduce dynamic evaluation via (a) adversarial test splits (e.g., perturbed images or counterfactual text [7]) and (b) iterative leaderboard updates with hidden test cases to prevent gaming.
(3) **Multi-Dimensional Task Design**:
Benchmarks will include auxiliary tasks (e.g., explanation generation, robustness to perturbations) alongside primary accuracy metrics. For example, a vision benchmark might require models to justify classifications via natural language [8].
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Audit Existing Benchmarks**:
• Quantify biases in ImageNet (geographic), GLUE (linguistic), and WILDS (domain shifts) using statistical disparity metrics [1, 9].
• Measure robustness gaps via performance drops on perturbed or out-of-distribution data (e.g., ImageNet-C [10]).
2. **Construct Bias-Controlled Datasets**:
• Collaborate with domain experts to stratify data collection (e.g., balanced sampling across 50+ countries for vision tasks).
• For NLP, integrate code-switched text from platforms like Twitter and Wikipedia [6].
3. **Design Dynamic Evaluation**:
• Develop adversarial test splits using gradient-based perturbations (vision) and counterfactual edits (text) [7].
• Implement a rolling leaderboard with monthly hidden test updates to track long-term progress.
4. **Benchmark Multi-Task Performance**:
• Train models on joint tasks (e.g., classification + explanation generation) and evaluate trade-offs between accuracy and interpretability [8].
• Compare against single-task baselines to isolate the impact of auxiliary objectives.
5. **Quantify Real-World Transfer**:
• Deploy top-performing models in downstream applications (e.g., medical imaging or low-resource translation) and measure performance gaps relative to benchmark scores.
• Conduct human evaluations to assess practical utility (e.g., clinician trust in model explanations).

1. Title:
Advancing Dataset and Benchmark Design for Robust and Scalable AI Evaluation
2. Problem Statement:
Current AI benchmarks and datasets suffer from critical limitations that hinder their ability to reliably measure model performance, generalize across domains, and scale with evolving AI capabilities. Key issues include:
- **Static and Narrow Evaluation**: Many benchmarks (e.g., GLUE, SuperGLUE) focus on narrow tasks and fixed datasets, failing to adapt to emerging challenges or adversarial scenarios (Srivastava et al., 2022).
- **Data Quality and Bias**: Widely used datasets (e.g., ImageNet) contain labeling errors, biases, and spurious correlations that skew model evaluation (Bender et al., 2021; Birhane et al., 2021).
- **Scalability Gaps**: Benchmarks for long-context or multimodal tasks (e.g., Long-Range Arena) lack realistic complexity or diversity (Tay et al., 2020).
- **Overfitting and Benchmark Leakage**: Models often exploit dataset artifacts or benchmark-specific patterns, leading to inflated performance metrics (Zellers et al., 2019).
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that a systematic redesign of dataset and benchmark construction can address these limitations by:
- **Dynamic and Task-Agnostic Evaluation**: Introducing procedurally generated or evolving benchmarks (e.g., Dynabench) to mitigate overfitting and adapt to model advancements (Kiela et al., 2021).
- **Bias and Robustness Audits**: Implementing rigorous data curation pipelines with human-in-the-loop validation and adversarial filtering (Prabhu & Birhane, 2020).
- **Scalable Multimodal and Long-Context Tasks**: Designing benchmarks that combine text, audio, and video with variable-length dependencies to reflect real-world complexity (Jaegle et al., 2021).
Our central hypothesis is that these improvements will yield benchmarks that better correlate with real-world model performance and generalize across domains.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a three-part framework for dataset and benchmark innovation:
(1) **Dynamic Benchmark Generation**:
- Develop a toolkit for procedurally generating tasks with controllable complexity (e.g., grammar-based text synthesis or synthetic image rendering).
- Incorporate human-AI collaboration for iterative refinement, inspired by Dynabench’s adversarial collection (Kiela et al., 2021).
(2) **Data Quality and Bias Mitigation**:
- Design a multi-stage auditing pipeline: (i) automated detection of label errors (Northcutt et al., 2021), (ii) crowdsourced bias identification (Birhane et al., 2021), and (iii) adversarial perturbation testing (Ribeiro et al., 2020).
- Integrate dataset "nutrition labels" to document provenance, biases, and limitations (Holland et al., 2018).
(3) **Scalable Evaluation Protocols**:
- Extend the Long-Range Arena (Tay et al., 2020) with multimodal tasks (e.g., video-to-text retrieval with hour-long context).
- Introduce "benchmark rotation" to periodically retire tasks prone to overfitting and introduce new challenges.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Benchmark Dynamic Task Generation**:
- Generate synthetic tasks with varying complexity (e.g., nested dependencies in text, occlusions in images).
- Compare model performance on static vs. dynamic benchmarks to measure generalization gaps.
2. **Audit Existing Datasets**:
- Apply our auditing pipeline to 3-5 popular datasets (e.g., COCO, SQuAD).
- Quantify label errors, biases, and spurious correlations before/after remediation.
3. **Evaluate Scalability**:
- Train models on our extended Long-Range Arena with multimodal tasks.
- Measure performance decay as context length increases (1K to 1M tokens).
4. **Test Robustness to Adversarial Shifts**:
- Introduce controlled distribution shifts (e.g., domain transfer, synthetic corruptions).
- Compare model performance on traditional benchmarks vs. our adversarially validated datasets.
5. **Longitudinal Benchmark Rotation Study**:
- Deploy benchmark rotation over 12 months, tracking model performance on retired vs. new tasks.
- Analyze whether rotation reduces overfitting and improves generalization.

Towards Robust and Scalable Benchmarks: Addressing Dataset Bias and Evaluation Gaps in Machine Learning
2. Problem Statement:
Current machine learning benchmarks often suffer from dataset bias, lack of diversity, and evaluation protocols that do not reflect real-world deployment conditions. For instance, widely used datasets like ImageNet and GLUE have been criticized for label noise, cultural biases, and oversimplified task formulations (Bender et al., 2021; Paullada et al., 2021). Additionally, benchmarks frequently prioritize narrow metrics (e.g., accuracy) over robustness, fairness, or computational efficiency, leading to models that perform well on static test sets but fail in dynamic environments (Recht et al., 2019). There is a pressing need for benchmarks that are both rigorous (statistically sound) and representative (diverse and scalable).
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that current benchmarking practices inadvertently incentivize models to exploit dataset-specific artifacts rather than learn generalizable patterns. For example, models trained on biased datasets may achieve high scores by memorizing spurious correlations (McCoy et al., 2019). Our central idea is that benchmarks must explicitly account for three dimensions:
- **Diversity**: Covering underrepresented domains (e.g., low-resource languages, long-tail distributions).
- **Dynamic Evaluation**: Testing models under distribution shifts and adversarial conditions.
- **Multi-Metric Trade-offs**: Balancing accuracy, robustness, and efficiency.
We posit that a benchmark framework incorporating these dimensions will better guide model development toward real-world applicability.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a three-part methodology to design next-generation benchmarks:
(1) **Bias-Aware Dataset Curation**:
- Leverage techniques from dataset auditing (e.g., *data cartography* (Swayamdipta et al., 2020)) to identify and mitigate biases.
- Introduce synthetic diversity via controlled perturbations (e.g., counterfactual augmentations (Gardner et al., 2021)).
(2) **Dynamic Evaluation Protocols**:
- Design benchmarks with time-varying data splits (e.g., simulating concept drift) and adversarial challenges (e.g., targeted attacks (Carlini & Wagner, 2017)).
- Incorporate human-in-the-loop evaluation for subjective tasks (e.g., dialogue systems).
(3) **Holistic Metrics**:
- Develop composite metrics that weigh accuracy, robustness (e.g., performance under distribution shifts (Taori et al., 2020)), and efficiency (e.g., FLOPs vs. performance trade-offs).
- Use Pareto frontiers to visualize trade-offs across metrics.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Audit Existing Benchmarks**:
- Quantify bias in popular datasets (e.g., label noise in ImageNet, demographic skew in NLP datasets) using statistical tests (e.g., *disparate impact ratio*).
- Re-evaluate SOTA models on cleaned subsets to measure performance drops.
2. **Construct Diverse Test Suites**:
- Curate *long-tail* subsets (e.g., rare classes in CIFAR-100) and *cross-cultural* data (e.g., multilingual translations of QA tasks).
- Partner with domain experts (e.g., linguists for low-resource languages).
3. **Stress-Test Models Under Distribution Shifts**:
- Evaluate on *wild variants* of benchmarks (e.g., ImageNet-C (Hendrycks & Dietterich, 2019)).
- Measure robustness to synthetic corruptions (e.g., texture changes, word substitutions).
4. **Develop Dynamic Evaluation Pipelines**:
- Implement *rolling evaluation* where test data evolves over time (e.g., quarterly updates to mimic real-world drift).
- Integrate adversarial attacks (e.g., AutoAttack (Croce & Hein, 2020)) into standard benchmarks.
5. **Validate Metric Trade-offs**:
- Train models with multi-objective losses (e.g., accuracy + fairness constraints).
- Compare Pareto-optimal models against single-metric baselines on downstream tasks.

**Advancing AI Evaluation: A Framework for Dynamic, Multimodal, and Task-Agnostic Benchmarking**
2. Problem Statement:
Current AI benchmarks suffer from three critical limitations: (1) **static evaluation**, where models are tested on fixed datasets, leading to overfitting and inflated performance metrics (Recht et al., 2019); (2) **narrow modality focus**, with most benchmarks targeting single modalities (e.g., text or images) despite the rise of multimodal AI (Liang et al., 2022); and (3) **task-specific design**, which fails to measure generalization across diverse real-world scenarios (Taori et al., 2020). These limitations obscure the true capabilities and limitations of AI systems, hindering progress toward robust, generalizable models.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that a **dynamic, multimodal, and task-agnostic benchmarking framework** can provide a more accurate and comprehensive evaluation of AI systems. Dynamic evaluation, where test data evolves in response to model performance, can mitigate overfitting (Srivastava et al., 2023). Multimodal benchmarks can better reflect real-world complexity, as human intelligence inherently integrates multiple modalities (Alayrac et al., 2022). Finally, task-agnostic evaluation—where models are tested on unseen tasks derived from a shared underlying distribution—can better measure generalization (Bommasani et al., 2021).
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a three-part framework:
(1) **Dynamic Benchmark Construction**: We will develop a methodology for generating adaptive test sets that evolve based on model performance. Inspired by adversarial data collection (Kiela et al., 2021), we will use human-in-the-loop and model-in-the-loop techniques to iteratively refine test data, ensuring it remains challenging.
(2) **Multimodal Task Integration**: We will design a unified evaluation protocol for multimodal tasks, leveraging datasets like ImageNet-1K (Deng et al., 2009) for vision, The Pile (Gao et al., 2020) for text, and AudioSet (Gemmeke et al., 2017) for audio. Cross-modal tasks (e.g., text-to-image retrieval) will be included to assess integration capabilities.
(3) **Task-Agnostic Evaluation**: We will formalize a "task soup" protocol, where models are evaluated on a mixture of unseen tasks sampled from a predefined distribution (e.g., CLIP-style tasks for vision-language models). This will measure zero-shot generalization without task-specific fine-tuning.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Validate Dynamic Benchmarking**:
• Compare static vs. dynamic evaluation on GPT-4 and LLaMA-3, measuring performance drift over time.
• Use human annotators to iteratively harden test sets (following Kiela et al., 2021) and quantify the gap between static and dynamic metrics.
2. **Assess Multimodal Generalization**:
• Train and evaluate models on our unified benchmark, including cross-modal tasks (e.g., image captioning, audio-text alignment).
• Measure performance drop when models are tested on unseen modality combinations (e.g., video+text for models trained on image+text).
3. **Test Task-Agnostic Evaluation**:
• Sample 100 tasks from a "task soup" distribution and evaluate zero-shot performance of CLIP, Flamingo, and GPT-4V.
• Compare to traditional task-specific benchmarks to quantify generalization gaps.
4. **Benchmark Scalability and Efficiency**:
• Profile computational costs of dynamic evaluation vs. static benchmarks.
• Propose optimizations (e.g., caching, parallel human annotation) to make dynamic benchmarking feasible at scale.
5. **Real-World Deployment Validation**:
• Collaborate with industry partners (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic) to deploy our benchmark in their evaluation pipelines.
• Measure correlation between our metrics and real-world deployment performance (e.g., user satisfaction, error rates).

Advancing Dataset and Benchmark Design for Robust Machine Learning Evaluation
2. Problem Statement:
Current machine learning benchmarks often suffer from critical limitations that hinder their ability to reliably measure model performance and generalization. Key issues include: (1) dataset bias and lack of diversity, leading to overestimated model capabilities (Torralba & Efros, 2011); (2) static benchmarks that quickly become obsolete due to data drift or adversarial exploitation (Recht et al., 2019); (3) insufficient coverage of edge cases and failure modes, resulting in inflated robustness claims (Koh et al., 2021); and (4) misalignment between benchmark metrics and real-world utility (Blagec et al., 2022). These problems create a growing gap between reported performance and actual model reliability in deployment.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that a systematic redesign of benchmark construction methodologies can significantly improve the reliability of ML evaluation. Our central thesis is that benchmarks must incorporate three key properties: (1) dynamic updating to reflect evolving real-world conditions, (2) rigorous stratification of difficulty levels to expose capability boundaries, and (3) multi-dimensional metric frameworks that capture both task performance and failure modes.
Drawing on insights from recent work on dataset cartography (Swayamdipta et al., 2020) and adaptive testing (Martinez et al., 2021), we propose that benchmarks should actively identify and emphasize "challenge examples" - data points that reveal model weaknesses during evaluation. We further hypothesize that incorporating human-in-the-loop auditing (Kiela et al., 2021) during benchmark development can significantly improve the ecological validity of evaluation protocols.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a comprehensive framework for next-generation benchmark design, implemented through three interconnected components:
(1) Dynamic Benchmark Architecture:
We will develop a modular benchmark system with versioned updates, inspired by the ImageNet ecosystem (Deng et al., 2009) but with automated data refresh mechanisms. The system will include:
• Continuous data ingestion pipelines with quality filters
• Adversarial example generation hooks (following Tramèr et al., 2020)
• Performance drift detection modules based on statistical process control
(2) Difficulty-Stratified Evaluation:
Building on the concept of "taskonomy" (Zamir et al., 2018), we will create stratified test sets that explicitly categorize examples by:
• Linguistic complexity (for NLP) or visual complexity (for CV)
• Frequency of occurrence in training distributions
• Known failure modes from prior model evaluations
(3) Multi-Dimensional Metrics Framework:
Moving beyond single-number metrics, we will implement:
• Robustness scoring inspired by the Checklist methodology (Ribeiro et al., 2020)
• Efficiency-cost tradeoff curves (Schwartz et al., 2020)
• Human alignment scores via expert evaluations (Bender et al., 2021)
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. Benchmark Current Limitations:
• Conduct meta-analysis of 50+ recent ML papers to quantify benchmark inflation effects
• Replicate key SOTA results while systematically varying test conditions
• Identify most common failure modes across vision, language, and multimodal tasks
2. Develop Dynamic Benchmark Prototypes:
• Select 3 diverse domains (e.g., medical imaging, legal NLP, autonomous driving)
• Implement automated data versioning with cryptographic hashing
• Design adversarial probing interfaces following Carlini et al. (2019)
3. Validate Difficulty Stratification:
• Recruit domain experts to label challenge examples
• Train diagnostic models to predict example difficulty
• Verify stratification effectiveness via controlled ablation studies
4. Test Multi-Dimensional Evaluation:
• Compare traditional vs. our new metrics on 10 existing models
• Measure correlation between metric dimensions and real-world deployment outcomes
• Conduct human studies to validate metric interpretability
5. Longitudinal Deployment Study:
• Release benchmark suite to research community
• Monitor performance claims over 12-month period
• Analyze adaptation strategies used by top-performing teams

1. Title:
Advancing AI Evaluation: A Framework for Dynamic, Multimodal, and Bias-Aware Benchmarking
2. Problem Statement:
Current AI benchmarks suffer from three critical limitations: (1) Static datasets fail to capture real-world dynamics, leading to overfitting and poor generalization (Recht et al., 2019); (2) Most benchmarks are unimodal (e.g., text-only or image-only), while real-world tasks often require multimodal reasoning (Liang et al., 2022); (3) Existing benchmarks lack systematic bias measurement tools, masking disparities in model performance across demographic groups (Blodgett et al., 2021). These gaps hinder progress toward robust, generalizable AI systems.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that a next-generation benchmarking framework must address these limitations simultaneously. Specifically:
- **Dynamic Evaluation**: Benchmarks should incorporate temporal shifts in data distribution to simulate real-world evolution (e.g., climate change impacts on satellite imagery or linguistic drift in social media).
- **Multimodal Integration**: Tasks requiring cross-modal reasoning (e.g., text-to-image retrieval with compositional queries) will better stress-test emergent capabilities in foundation models.
- **Bias Quantification**: Fine-grained bias metrics (e.g., intersectional fairness across race, gender, and dialect) must be baked into benchmark design rather than added post hoc.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a three-part framework:
(1) **Dynamic Benchmark Construction**:
- Leverage time-stamped datasets (e.g., arXiv papers with revision histories or longitudinal medical records) to create "time-travel" evaluation splits. Models will be tested on future data splits unseen during training.
- Implement distribution shift detectors (based on Rabanser et al., 2019) to automatically flag when benchmark tasks require updates.
(2) **Multimodal Task Design**:
- Develop a unified evaluation protocol for cross-modal tasks, building on the "OmniBench" approach (Xiao et al., 2023) but with stricter adversarial controls.

(3) **Bias-Aware Metrics**:
- Extend the intersectional bias measurement toolkit from NLP (Sheng et al., 2021) to multimodal contexts.
- Integrate counterfactual fairness testing (Kusner et al., 2017) by generating synthetic perturbations to demographic attributes in input data.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:

1. Title:
Advancing Dataset and Benchmark Design for Robust Machine Learning Evaluation
2. Problem Statement:
Current machine learning benchmarks often suffer from critical limitations that hinder their ability to reliably measure model performance and generalization. Key issues include: (1) dataset bias and lack of diversity, where models overfit to spurious correlations (Torralba & Efros, 2011); (2) benchmark saturation, where leaderboard scores plateau despite unresolved real-world challenges (Recht et al., 2019); (3) misalignment between benchmark tasks and practical deployment scenarios (Liang et al., 2022); and (4) insufficient stress-testing for robustness, fairness, and out-of-distribution generalization (Koh et al., 2021). These limitations create a false sense of progress and obscure the true capabilities and limitations of models.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that current benchmark design practices prioritize narrow, task-specific performance metrics over holistic evaluation of model robustness, adaptability, and real-world utility. For example, ImageNet accuracy fails to capture model sensitivity to texture bias (Geirhos et al., 2019), while NLP benchmarks like GLUE often overlook compositional reasoning (Keysers et al., 2020).
Our central hypothesis is that a new generation of benchmarks must incorporate:
- **Controlled diversity**: Systematic variation of factors (e.g., demographics, linguistic styles, or geometric transformations) to disentangle true learning from dataset artifacts.
- **Dynamic evaluation**: Adaptive test suites that evolve in response to model strengths/weaknesses, preventing overfitting (Dodge et al., 2021).
- **Multi-dimensional metrics**: Simultaneous measurement of accuracy, robustness, computational efficiency, and fairness (Ethayarajh & Jurafsky, 2021).
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a three-part framework for next-generation benchmark design:
(1) **Controlled Dataset Synthesis**:
- Leverage generative models (e.g., diffusion models or LLMs) to create synthetic datasets with precise control over confounding variables (Liu et al., 2023). For example, generate images where object shape and texture are independently varied to diagnose inductive biases.
- Implement counterfactual augmentation (Gardner et al., 2021) to systematically test model sensitivity to spurious features.
(2) **Benchmark Dynamics Engine**:
- Develop an adversarial benchmark generator that identifies model weaknesses via gradient-based or evolutionary search (Perez et al., 2022). This engine will automatically create "challenge sets" targeting vulnerable subpopulations or edge cases.
- Incorporate human-in-the-loop refinement to ensure generated tasks maintain real-world relevance (Kiela et al., 2021).
(3) **Unified Evaluation Protocol**:
- Design a meta-evaluation framework that combines:
- Traditional accuracy metrics
- Robustness measures (e.g., performance drop under distribution shifts)
- Efficiency metrics (FLOPs, memory footprint)
- Fairness audits (disaggregated performance across subgroups)
- Implement this as an open-source toolkit with standardized reporting formats.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Diagnose Current Benchmark Limitations**:
- Conduct large-scale replication studies of 5-10 major benchmarks (e.g., ImageNet, GLUE, WILDS) to quantify saturation and robustness gaps.
- Use interpretability tools (e.g., saliency maps or concept activation vectors) to identify dataset-specific shortcuts models exploit.
2. **Validate Synthetic Data Fidelity**:
- Train models on synthetic datasets with known confounding variables (e.g., texture-shape conflicts) and compare their failure modes to real-world datasets.
- Conduct human studies to verify synthetic data preserves task-relevant features (following protocols from Santurkar et al., 2023).
3. **Test Dynamic Benchmarking**:
- Deploy the adversarial engine against state-of-the-art models in vision and NLP.
- Measure the correlation between performance on dynamically generated challenges and real-world deployment outcomes (using datasets like TAO for vision or Dynabench for NLP).
4. **Holistic Model Ranking**:
- Evaluate 20+ representative models using the unified metrics framework.
- Analyze trade-offs (e.g., accuracy vs. robustness) to derive Pareto-optimal benchmark scoring rules.
5. **Longitudinal Benchmarking**:
- Track model performance on evolving benchmark versions over 12 months to assess whether the framework detects meaningful progress vs. overfitting.
- Compare leaderboard dynamics against traditional static benchmarks.

1. Title:
Advancing AI Evaluation: A Framework for Dynamic, Multi-Dimensional Benchmarking
2. Problem Statement:
Current AI benchmarks suffer from critical limitations that hinder their ability to accurately assess model capabilities. First, static datasets (e.g., ImageNet, GLUE) are prone to benchmark overfitting, where models exploit dataset-specific biases rather than demonstrating generalizable intelligence (Recht et al., 2019). Second, most benchmarks evaluate narrow task-specific performance rather than measuring broader cognitive abilities like reasoning, robustness, and adaptability (Srivastava et al., 2022). Third, existing benchmarks lack mechanisms to dynamically adapt to evolving model capabilities, leading to saturation (e.g., human-level performance on MNIST) without meaningful progress (Rajpurkar et al., 2018). There is an urgent need for a new paradigm in benchmarking that addresses these limitations while maintaining reproducibility and scalability.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that a dynamic, multi-dimensional benchmarking framework can provide a more accurate and comprehensive evaluation of AI systems. Key insights driving this work include:
- **Dynamic Evaluation**: Benchmarks should evolve in response to model improvements, avoiding saturation (Zellers et al., 2019).
- **Multi-Dimensional Metrics**: Evaluation should measure not just accuracy but also robustness (Taori et al., 2020), efficiency (Ding et al., 2021), and fairness (Bender et al., 2021).
- **Generalization Testing**: Benchmarks should include out-of-distribution and adversarial examples to test true generalization (Koh et al., 2021).
Our central hypothesis is that a benchmark incorporating these principles will better discriminate between models that merely memorize patterns and those that exhibit robust, generalizable intelligence.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose to develop a novel benchmarking framework with three key components:
(1) **Dynamic Dataset Generation**:
- We will design a procedurally generated benchmark where tasks and data distributions can be continuously varied to prevent overfitting. This builds on work in dynamic evaluation (Kiela et al., 2021) but extends it to multi-modal tasks.
- We will incorporate human-in-the-loop validation to ensure generated tasks remain meaningful and aligned with real-world challenges.
(2) **Multi-Dimensional Evaluation Metrics**:
- We will define a suite of metrics covering accuracy, robustness (via adversarial perturbations), efficiency (FLOPs vs. performance), and fairness (disparate impact across subgroups).
- Inspired by BIG-bench (Srivastava et al., 2022), we will include tasks that require compositionality and few-shot learning.
(3) **Adaptive Difficulty Scaling**:
- We will implement a "benchmark AI" that adjusts task difficulty based on model performance, similar to ELO ratings in games (Balduzzi et al., 2019).
- This system will use meta-learning to identify model weaknesses and generate targeted challenges.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Benchmark Design and Validation**:
- Develop prototype tasks for vision, language, and reasoning domains.
- Validate task quality via human expert review and baseline model testing.
2. **Dynamic Evaluation Testing**:
- Train models on initial benchmark tasks, then evaluate on dynamically generated holdout sets.
- Compare performance degradation vs. static benchmarks to measure overfitting.
3. **Multi-Dimensional Metric Analysis**:
- Evaluate leading models (e.g., GPT-4, Claude 3) across all metrics.
- Use clustering techniques to identify trade-offs between accuracy, robustness, and efficiency.
4. **Adaptive Difficulty Scaling**:
- Implement the benchmark AI and test its ability to scale difficulty appropriately.
- Measure whether adaptive testing provides better discrimination between model capabilities.
5. **Real-World Deployment**:
- Release the benchmark as an open-source toolkit.
- Collaborate with major model developers to adopt it for model evaluation.

1. Title:
Towards Robust and Scalable Benchmarks: Addressing Dataset Bias and Evaluation Gaps in Machine Learning
2. Problem Statement:
Current machine learning benchmarks often suffer from dataset bias, lack of diversity, and evaluation protocols that do not reflect real-world deployment conditions. Widely used datasets like ImageNet, GLUE, and WMT have been criticized for their limited scope, potential annotation artifacts, and over-reliance on static test sets, which can lead to overfitting and inflated performance metrics (Torralba & Efros, 2011; Gururangan et al., 2018). Additionally, benchmarks often fail to account for distribution shifts, adversarial robustness, and computational efficiency, creating a disconnect between research progress and practical applicability. There is a pressing need for more rigorous, dynamic, and representative evaluation frameworks to drive meaningful advancements in AI.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that current benchmark limitations stem from three key issues: (1) static datasets that do not evolve with model capabilities, (2) narrow task definitions that ignore real-world complexity, and (3) insufficient emphasis on robustness and fairness metrics. Recent work by Recht et al. (2019) demonstrated that models trained on ImageNet perform significantly worse on carefully curated "ImageNet-v2" test sets, highlighting the fragility of existing benchmarks. Similarly, Kiela et al. (2021) showed that NLP benchmarks often contain spurious correlations that models exploit.
Our central hypothesis is that a new generation of benchmarks—incorporating dynamic updates, multi-modal tasks, and stress-testing under distribution shifts—will provide a more accurate measure of model generalization and robustness. We propose that such benchmarks will reveal gaps in current methods and guide the development of more reliable AI systems.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a three-pronged approach to design and validate next-generation benchmarks:
(1) **Dynamic Dataset Curation**:
We will develop a framework for continuously updating benchmark datasets to prevent overfitting. Inspired by the "living benchmarks" concept (Dodge et al., 2021), we will use crowd-sourcing and automated adversarial example generation (e.g., via techniques from Tramèr et al., 2020) to expand test sets iteratively. This will include stratified sampling to ensure coverage of rare but critical edge cases.
(2) **Multi-Dimensional Evaluation Metrics**:
Beyond accuracy, we will integrate metrics for robustness (e.g., performance under distribution shifts), fairness (disparate impact across subgroups), and efficiency (FLOPs, latency). We will build on the CheckList framework (Ribeiro et al., 2020) to include task-specific stress tests, such as evaluating vision models on occluded or perturbed images.
(3) **Benchmarking Infrastructure**:
To support reproducible and scalable evaluation, we will design an open-source platform that automates dataset versioning, metric computation, and model comparison. This will extend existing tools like Dynabench (Kiela et al., 2021) with support for multi-modal tasks (e.g., vision-language reasoning) and real-time feedback loops for model developers.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Characterize Current Benchmark Limitations**:
• Conduct a meta-analysis of top-tier conference papers (NeurIPS, ICML) to quantify how often models fail under distribution shifts or adversarial conditions.
• Re-evaluate state-of-the-art models on held-out "hidden" test sets (similar to ImageNet-v2) to measure overfitting.
2. **Design Dynamic Datasets**:
• Collaborate with domain experts to curate a multi-modal benchmark (text, images, audio) with controlled distribution shifts.
• Use adversarial augmentation (e.g., TextAttack for NLP) to generate challenging edge cases.
3. **Develop Robustness Metrics**:
• Implement metrics for invariance (e.g., performance on semantically equivalent inputs) and fairness (disaggregated accuracy across demographic groups).
• Validate these metrics on existing models to establish baselines.
4. **Build and Deploy Benchmarking Platform**:
• Prototype a lightweight API for submitting models and receiving evaluation reports.
• Integrate with popular frameworks (Hugging Face, PyTorch) to lower adoption barriers.
5. **Large-Scale Validation**:
• Organize a community challenge using our benchmark to attract diverse model submissions.
• Analyze results to identify systematic weaknesses in current architectures (e.g., transformer-based models’ sensitivity to token permutations).

Advancing Dataset and Benchmark Design for Robust AI Evaluation
2. Problem Statement:
Current AI benchmarks and datasets suffer from critical limitations that hinder their ability to reliably measure model performance and generalization. Key issues include: (1) Static datasets that fail to capture real-world distribution shifts (Koh et al., 2023), (2) Benchmark contamination due to test data leakage into training corpora (Magar & Schwartz, 2022), (3) Narrow task definitions that lack cross-domain evaluation (Zhou et al., 2023), and (4) Insufficient documentation of dataset provenance and biases (Paullada et al., 2021). These limitations create a false sense of progress, where models appear to improve on benchmarks but fail in practical deployment scenarios.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that current benchmark design flaws stem from an overemphasis on static, task-specific evaluation rather than dynamic, multi-faceted assessment. Recent work has shown that models can exploit dataset artifacts (Geirhos et al., 2020) or memorize test sets (Carlini et al., 2023) without genuine understanding. Our central thesis is that a new generation of benchmarks should incorporate three key principles: (1) Dynamic adaptation to prevent overfitting, (2) Cross-domain task transfer to measure generalization, and (3) Comprehensive documentation of data sources and limitations. We believe this approach will yield more reliable indicators of true model capabilities.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose to develop a framework for creating robust benchmarks through three interconnected innovations:
(1) Dynamic Benchmark Construction:
We will design a benchmark generation system that automatically creates new test variants by applying semantically-preserving transformations (e.g., paraphrasing, domain shifts) to existing tasks. This builds on techniques like Dynabench (Kiela et al., 2021) but extends them with programmatic transformations validated by human annotators. The goal is to prevent models from relying on superficial patterns.
(2) Cross-Domain Evaluation Protocol:
Inspired by recent work on out-of-distribution generalization (Koh et al., 2021), we will develop a standardized evaluation protocol where models are tested on progressively more distant domain shifts from their training data. This will include both natural distribution shifts (e.g., medical text to legal text) and adversarial perturbations.
(3) Dataset Documentation Standards:
We will create a rigorous documentation framework extending Datasheets for Datasets (Gebru et al., 2021) with:
- Provenance tracking via cryptographic hashing of data sources
- Bias audits using methods like the Bias Taxonomy (Blodgett et al., 2020)
- Version control for dynamic benchmarks
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. Benchmark Dynamic Adaptation Validation:
• Create 10 variants of existing NLP benchmarks (GLUE, SuperGLUE) using our transformation pipeline
• Measure performance drop of SOTA models (e.g., GPT-4, LLaMA-2) across variants to quantify overfitting
• Compare with human performance on same variants to establish ceiling
2. Cross-Domain Generalization Testing:
• Select 5 core domains (news, academic, dialogue, etc.) with annotated sub-domains
• Train models on one domain, test on increasingly distant ones using our protocol
• Analyze failure modes via error clustering (Pandya et al., 2023)
3. Contamination Detection:
• Implement cryptographic checksums for test sets based on BigScience's approach (Luccioni et al., 2023)
• Develop neural methods to detect memorized test examples using activation patterns
4. Real-World Deployment Validation:
• Partner with 3 industry teams to evaluate models on our benchmarks vs. their production metrics
• Correlate benchmark performance with operational KPIs (e.g., user satisfaction, error rates)
5. Ablation Studies:
• Isolate impact of individual documentation components on model improvement rates
• Measure how different transformation types affect benchmark difficulty
• Analyze computational cost vs. evaluation reliability tradeoffs

**Towards Robust and Scalable Benchmarks: Addressing Dataset Biases and Evaluation Gaps in Machine Learning**
2. Problem Statement:
Current machine learning benchmarks often suffer from hidden biases, dataset artifacts, and evaluation protocols that fail to generalize to real-world scenarios. For instance, many datasets (e.g., ImageNet, GLUE) exhibit annotation artifacts or distributional skews that models exploit to achieve inflated performance without true understanding (Gururangan et al., 2018; Torralba & Efros, 2011). Additionally, benchmarks frequently lack diversity in task complexity, domain coverage, and adversarial robustness, leading to overfitting to narrow metrics (Recht et al., 2019; Kiela et al., 2021). There is a pressing need for benchmarks that systematically measure generalization, fairness, and scalability across modalities (text, vision, multimodal) while mitigating dataset-specific biases.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that existing benchmarks underestimate model brittleness due to three key gaps: (1) **task diversity** (over-reliance on static, single-domain tasks), (2) **evaluation depth** (surface-level metrics like accuracy ignoring reasoning or causal understanding), and (3) **bias propagation** (datasets inheriting societal biases or annotation artifacts). Our central idea is that a benchmark framework incorporating **dynamic task generation**, **adversarial perturbations**, and **cross-domain transfer** can expose these limitations and drive progress toward more robust models. For example, recent work by Barbu et al. (2019) showed that models fail catastrophically on slightly shifted distributions, underscoring the need for stress-testing benchmarks.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a three-pronged approach to design next-generation benchmarks:
(1) **Dynamic Task Synthesis**:
We will develop a framework to generate tasks with controllable complexity (e.g., varying compositional depth in text or visual scenes) using procedural generation (Johnson et al., 2017) and synthetic data augmentation (Sinha et al., 2021). This will allow systematic testing of generalization beyond fixed datasets.
(2) **Bias-Aware Dataset Auditing**:
We will design automated tools to detect and mitigate biases via counterfactual augmentation (Gardner et al., 2020) and adversarial filtering (Pezeshkpour et al., 2022). For example, we will perturb demographic attributes in text or image data to measure fairness gaps.
(3) **Cross-Modal Evaluation Protocol**:
We will introduce a unified evaluation suite spanning text, vision, and multimodal tasks with shared metrics for robustness (e.g., invariance to perturbations) and scalability (e.g., performance-compute tradeoffs). Inspired by HELM (Liang et al., 2022), we will include fine-grained subpopulation analysis.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Audit Existing Benchmarks**:
• Quantify annotation artifacts in popular datasets (e.g., COCO, SQuAD) using statistical tests (e.g., n-gram overlap bias in QA).
• Measure model sensitivity to synthetic distribution shifts (e.g., texture changes in ImageNet-C (Hendrycks & Dietterich, 2019)).
2. **Develop Dynamic Task Generators**:
• For text: Generate compositional questions with controlled logical depth (e.g., "If A and B, then C unless D").
• For vision: Render 3D scenes with varying object occlusion and lighting conditions (cf. Kubricht et al., 2017).
3. **Evaluate Bias Mitigation Strategies**:
• Test debiasing methods (e.g., reweighting, adversarial training) on our synthetic benchmarks.
• Compare fairness metrics (e.g., demographic parity) across perturbed datasets.
4. **Benchmark Scalability**:
• Train models of varying sizes (100M–10B parameters) on dynamic tasks to measure scaling laws.
• Compare efficiency (FLOPs, memory) against static benchmarks like SuperGLUE (Wang et al., 2019).
5. **Real-World Validation**:
• Deploy top-performing models from our benchmark in production-like settings (e.g., medical imaging with domain shift).
• Collaborate with domain experts to annotate failure modes (e.g., misdiagnosis in radiology).

**Advancing Dataset and Benchmark Design for Robust Evaluation of Machine Learning Models**
2. Problem Statement:
Current machine learning benchmarks often suffer from critical limitations that hinder their ability to reliably measure model performance. Key issues include: (1) **data leakage** due to overlapping training and evaluation sets (e.g., in image classification benchmarks like ImageNet-1k, where test set contamination has been documented [1]), (2) **narrow task scope** that fails to capture real-world complexity (e.g., static benchmarks like GLUE lack dynamic or multimodal challenges [2]), and (3) **evaluation metrics misalignment**, where proxy metrics (e.g., accuracy) do not correlate with downstream utility (e.g., in medical imaging tasks [3]). These flaws lead to overestimated model capabilities and poor generalization in practice.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that systematic flaws in dataset and benchmark design are a primary bottleneck in measuring true progress in machine learning. For instance, recent work has shown that models achieving high scores on existing benchmarks often fail under controlled stress tests [4]. Our central idea is that **three principles** can address these gaps:
- **Dynamic Adversarial Data Collection (DADC)**: Continuously evolving benchmarks to counteract model overfitting, as demonstrated in NLP by Dynabench [5].
- **Task Compositionality**: Designing benchmarks that require combining multiple skills (e.g., vision + reasoning), inspired by procedural generation in datasets like ProcTHOR [6].
- **Metric Robustness**: Developing metrics that penalize shortcut learning, building on advances in fairness-aware evaluation [7].
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a framework for next-generation dataset and benchmark design, structured in three parts:
**(1) Leakage-Free Data Curation**:
- Implement cryptographic hashing (e.g., SHA-256) to detect and remove near-duplicates across splits, extending methods from [1].
- Introduce temporal splits for time-series data (e.g., medical records), ensuring no future data leaks into training, as in [8].
**(2) Dynamic Benchmarking Pipeline**:
- Deploy a DADC platform where human annotators and models interactively challenge each other, akin to [5], but extended to multimodal tasks.
- Integrate procedural generation for scalable, diverse task variants (e.g., 3D scene understanding via Unity-based synthesis [6]).
**(3) Multi-Dimensional Evaluation**:
- Replace single-score metrics with a **robustness scorecard**, incorporating stress tests (e.g., counterfactual invariance [9]) and efficiency metrics (FLOPs vs. accuracy trade-offs [10]).
- Leverage Bayesian uncertainty estimation to quantify metric reliability, as in [11].
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Quantify Benchmark Contamination**:
- Audit 10 major benchmarks (e.g., ImageNet, SQuAD) using hashing and embedding similarity (CLIP for images, BERT for text).
- Measure performance drop after decontamination, comparing to [1]’s findings.
2. **Validate Dynamic Data Collection**:
- Pilot DADC for a vision-language task (e.g., VQA), recruiting 100 annotators to challenge a pretrained LLaMA-2 model.
- Track the "gap" between human and model performance over iterations, as in [5].
3. **Test Compositional Generalization**:
- Generate 1,000 procedurally varied tasks (e.g., "find objects in synthetic scenes with occlusions") using ProcTHOR [6].
- Evaluate whether models trained on static data (COCO) fail, while those trained on dynamic data adapt.
4. **Metric Alignment Study**:
- Corrogate expert judgments (e.g., radiologists’ diagnoses) with model predictions on CheXpert [12].
- Train a meta-evaluator to predict expert disagreement, extending [11].
5. **Efficiency-Accuracy Tradeoff Benchmark**:
- Profile 50 models (ViTs, ConvNeXts) on our scorecard, measuring Pareto frontiers across hardware (TPUv4, A100).

Advancing AI Evaluation: A Framework for Dynamic, Multimodal, and Bias-Aware Benchmarking
2. Problem Statement:
Current AI benchmarks suffer from three critical limitations: (1) Static datasets lead to overfitting and fail to capture real-world dynamics, as models exploit dataset-specific artifacts rather than learning generalizable patterns (Recht et al., 2019). (2) Most benchmarks are unimodal (e.g., text-only or image-only), while real-world applications increasingly require multimodal reasoning (Liang et al., 2022). (3) Existing benchmarks inadequately measure societal biases, particularly for non-English languages and underrepresented groups (Sheng et al., 2021). These gaps hinder progress toward robust, fair, and generalizable AI systems.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that a next-generation benchmarking framework must address these limitations through three key innovations: (1) Dynamic evaluation that continuously evolves test data to prevent overfitting, inspired by adversarial training but applied at the benchmark level (Dodge et al., 2021). (2) Cross-modal task design that forces models to integrate information across vision, language, and structured data, mirroring human cognition (Kiela et al., 2021). (3) Bias quantification that goes beyond aggregate metrics to identify fine-grained disparities across demographic axes (Blodgett et al., 2021).
4. Proposed Method:
(1) Dynamic Benchmark Construction:
We will develop a benchmark generation pipeline using human-AI collaboration. Human annotators will create seed tasks, while an adversarial model (based on GPT-4 or similar) will iteratively modify these tasks to break model shortcuts, validated through human review. This builds on the Dynabench approach (Kiela et al., 2021) but extends it to multimodal tasks.
(2) Multimodal Task Taxonomy:
We will define a hierarchical task structure spanning:
• Cross-modal retrieval (e.g., "Find the contract clause matching this diagram")
• Multimodal inference (e.g., "Explain why this MRI scan supports the diagnosis in the report")
• Temporal grounding (e.g., "Align video frames to corresponding steps in this recipe")
Tasks will be drawn from real-world domains like healthcare (CheXpert, Irvin et al. 2019) and law (LEXGLUE, Chalkidis et al. 2021).
(3) Bias Measurement Framework:
We will extend the BiasBench methodology (Sheng et al., 2021) with:
• Intersectional bias scores combining race, gender, and socioeconomic factors
• Localized metrics for non-English contexts (e.g., dialectal variations in Spanish)
• Stress testing via counterfactual examples (e.g., "How would this loan decision change if the applicant were 10 years older?")
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. Validate Dynamic Evaluation:
• Train models (BERT, CLIP, GPT-3.5) on initial benchmark versions, then test on iteratively updated tasks.
• Measure performance drop versus static benchmarks (e.g., GLUE, SuperGLUE) to quantify overfitting reduction.
2. Test Multimodal Generalization:
• Conduct cross-modal transfer experiments: Pretrain on text-only tasks, then evaluate on image+text versions (e.g., MNLI → SNLI-VE, Xie et al. 2019).
• Compare to models pretrained on our multimodal benchmark using relative improvement metrics.
3. Bias Auditing:
• Apply the HolisticBias framework (Smith et al., 2022) to measure disparities across 20+ demographic dimensions.
• Test bias mitigation methods (e.g., DALL-E 2’s post-hoc filtering) on our benchmark versus traditional datasets.
4. Real-World Deployment Testing:
• Partner with hospitals to evaluate diagnostic AI systems on our dynamically generated radiology reports + images.
• Track model drift over 6 months compared to static evaluation (MIMIC-CXR, Johnson et al. 2019).
5. Benchmark Scaling Analysis:
• Ablate components (dynamic updates, multimodal tasks, bias metrics) to isolate their individual contributions.
• Publish cost/performance tradeoffs for different benchmark sizes (1K–1M examples).

Towards Robust and Scalable Benchmarks: Addressing Dataset Biases and Evaluation Gaps in Machine Learning
2. Problem Statement:
Current machine learning benchmarks often suffer from hidden biases, dataset contamination, and evaluation protocols that do not reflect real-world deployment scenarios. For instance, widely used datasets like ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009) and GLUE (Wang et al., 2018) have been criticized for label noise, cultural biases, and task simplicity that overestimate model capabilities (Bender et al., 2021; Paullada et al., 2021). Additionally, benchmarks frequently lack diversity in data modalities (e.g., multimodal or long-context tasks) and fail to measure robustness under distribution shifts (Taori et al., 2020). The absence of standardized evaluation frameworks for emerging domains (e.g., generative AI or embodied agents) further exacerbates these challenges.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that systematic biases in dataset construction and evaluation protocols lead to inflated performance metrics, hindering progress in AI reliability and generalization. For example, language models trained on web-crawled data may inherit societal biases (Bolukbasi et al., 2016), while vision models often fail on out-of-distribution samples (Barbu et al., 2019). Our central hypothesis is that a rigorous, multi-dimensional benchmarking framework—incorporating diversity, robustness, and real-world utility metrics—can expose these limitations and drive the development of more generalizable models.
4. Proposed Method:
(1) **Dataset Auditing and Bias Mitigation**:
We will develop automated tools to quantify dataset biases (e.g., using SHAP values (Lundberg & Lee, 2017) or influence functions (Koh & Liang, 2017)) and propose corrective measures such as reweighting or adversarial filtering (Gardner et al., 2021). For example, we will audit text corpora for demographic biases using template-based probes (Nadeem et al., 2021).
(2) **Benchmark Design for Robustness**:
We will introduce a new benchmark suite, **RobustML**, with three pillars:
- **Distribution Shifts**: Curate datasets with controlled covariate shifts (e.g., WILDS (Koh et al., 2021)) and synthetic perturbations (e.g., ImageNet-C (Hendrycks & Dietterich, 2019)).
- **Multimodal Tasks**: Include cross-modal alignment tasks (e.g., text-to-audio retrieval) to evaluate holistic understanding.
- **Long-Tail Scenarios**: Incorporate rare classes and edge cases from domains like medical imaging (Irvin et al., 2019) or low-resource languages (Joshi et al., 2020).
(3) **Evaluation Protocol Standardization**:
We will advocate for dynamic evaluation protocols where test sets evolve over time to prevent overfitting (e.g., Dynabench (Kiela et al., 2021)) and propose metrics beyond accuracy, such as fairness (Mehrabi et al., 2021) and energy efficiency (Schwartz et al., 2020).

1. Title:
**Advancing Dataset and Benchmark Design for Robust AI Evaluation: Addressing Bias, Scalability, and Real-World Generalization**
2. Problem Statement:
Current AI benchmarks and datasets suffer from critical limitations that hinder their ability to reliably measure model performance and generalization. Key issues include:
- **Bias and Lack of Diversity**: Many datasets (e.g., ImageNet, COCO) exhibit geographic, demographic, or cultural biases, leading to skewed evaluations [1].
- **Static and Overused Benchmarks**: Widely adopted benchmarks (e.g., GLUE, SuperGLUE) are static, enabling models to overfit to test sets without reflecting real-world dynamics [2].
- **Scalability Gaps**: Few benchmarks stress-test long-tail or out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios, limiting their utility for safety-critical applications [3].
- **Task Isolation**: Most benchmarks evaluate narrow tasks (e.g., image classification) in isolation, failing to capture multimodal or compositional reasoning [4].
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that these limitations stem from outdated dataset design principles, which prioritize convenience over robustness. For example, static test sets incentivize "benchmark hacking," while homogeneous data fails to expose model vulnerabilities [5].
Our central idea is that **dynamic, diverse, and task-compositional benchmarks** can close these gaps. Specifically, we propose:
- **Dynamic Benchmarking**: Continuously evolving test sets to prevent overfitting.
- **Bias-Aware Sampling**: Stratified data collection to ensure representation across demographics, domains, and edge cases.
- **Task Interleaving**: Evaluating models on compositional tasks (e.g., vision + language) to measure emergent capabilities.
4. Proposed Method:
We will develop a framework for next-generation benchmarks through three pillars:
**(1) Dynamic Benchmark Construction**:
- Leverage generative models (e.g., diffusion models, LLMs) to synthesize adversarial or OOD test cases [6].
- Implement a "rolling evaluation" protocol where test sets refresh periodically, mimicking real-world distribution shifts.
**(2) Bias Mitigation via Stratified Sampling**:
- Partner with diverse annotators (e.g., via platforms like Amazon Mechanical Turk) to collect globally representative labels.
- Use statistical methods (e.g., propensity score matching) to balance datasets across confounding variables [7].
**(3) Task Compositionality**:
- Design benchmarks that require cross-modal reasoning (e.g., answering questions about procedurally generated videos).
- Integrate reinforcement learning environments (e.g., Unity, Habitat) to evaluate embodied AI agents [8].
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Audit Existing Benchmarks**:
- Quantify biases in 10 major datasets (e.g., ImageNet, WMT) using fairness metrics (e.g., demographic parity, equalized odds).
- Measure OOD performance by introducing synthetic corruptions (e.g., ImageNet-C) or adversarial perturbations.
2. **Pilot Dynamic Benchmarking**:
- Build a prototype "rolling" benchmark for text classification, where 20% of test data refreshes monthly.
- Compare model performance (F1, accuracy) against static benchmarks to assess generalization decay.
3. **Validate Bias Mitigation**:
- Collect a new image dataset with stratified sampling across 50 countries and 10 income brackets.
- Train models on this data and evaluate fairness gaps using metrics from [1].
4. **Test Task Compositionality**:
- Develop a benchmark combining vision, language, and action (e.g., "generate a recipe from a fridge photo").
- Evaluate GPT-4V, LLaVA, and Flamingo on this benchmark to identify capability gaps.
5. **Scalability and Adoption**:
- Deploy benchmarks on scalable platforms (e.g., Dynabench, EvalPlus [9]).
- Collaborate with MLCommons to integrate our framework into industry-standard evaluations.

1. Title:
**Towards Robust and Scalable Benchmarks: Addressing Dataset Bias and Evaluation Gaps in Machine Learning**
2. Problem Statement:
Current machine learning benchmarks often suffer from dataset bias, lack of diversity, and evaluation protocols that fail to capture real-world generalization. For instance, datasets like ImageNet and GLUE have been criticized for their narrow scope, annotation artifacts, and over-reliance on static test sets, which can lead to inflated performance metrics and poor out-of-distribution robustness (Recht et al., 2019; McCoy et al., 2019). Additionally, benchmarks for emerging domains (e.g., multimodal reasoning or long-context tasks) are either underdeveloped or lack standardized evaluation frameworks. This creates a gap between research progress and practical applicability, where models optimized for existing benchmarks may fail in real-world scenarios.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that current benchmarking practices disproportionately favor models that exploit dataset-specific biases rather than those with genuine generalization capabilities. Our central idea is that a systematic redesign of benchmarks—incorporating dynamic evaluation, adversarial stress tests, and diversity-aware sampling—can mitigate these issues. For example, recent work by Kiela et al. (2021) demonstrates that dynamically generated test sets reduce overfitting and better reflect model robustness. We propose that a combination of (1) **controlled synthetic data** to isolate specific capabilities, (2) **cross-domain transfer tasks** to measure generalization, and (3) **human-in-the-loop evaluation** for subjective tasks (e.g., dialogue) will yield more reliable benchmarks.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a three-part framework to address these challenges:
(1) **Bias-Aware Dataset Construction**:
We will design datasets with explicit controls for spurious correlations, leveraging synthetic data generation techniques (e.g., Sinha et al., 2021) and adversarial filtering (Zellers et al., 2018). For example, we will create vision datasets with procedurally generated textures to decouple shape and texture biases.
(2) **Dynamic Evaluation Protocols**:
Instead of static test sets, we will implement a benchmark-as-a-service platform where models are evaluated on freshly generated or crowdsourced tasks, similar to Dynabench (Kiela et al., 2021). This will include "hidden" test distributions to detect overfitting.
(3) **Generalization-Centric Metrics**:
We will introduce metrics that quantify robustness across domains (e.g., "generalization gap" between in-distribution and out-of-distribution performance) and fairness (e.g., subgroup performance disparities). These will build on recent work in distributionally robust optimization (Sagawa et al., 2020).
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Identify Bias Hotspots in Existing Benchmarks**:
• Conduct meta-analyses of top-performing models on ImageNet, GLUE, and WMT to identify common failure modes (e.g., texture bias in vision or annotation artifacts in NLP).
• Replicate experiments from Recht et al. (2019) to quantify the drop in performance on carefully curated test sets.
2. **Develop Synthetic Benchmarks**:
• Create synthetic datasets for controlled experiments (e.g., varying object backgrounds in vision or syntactic structures in NLP).
• Use these to measure model sensitivity to specific biases (e.g., does a vision model rely more on shape or texture?).
3. **Implement Dynamic Evaluation**:
• Deploy a Dynabench-style platform for NLP tasks, expanding to multimodal tasks (image+text).
• Compare model performance on static vs. dynamic evaluations to quantify overfitting.
4. **Cross-Domain Generalization Tests**:
• Train models on our synthetic benchmarks and evaluate on real-world datasets (and vice versa).
• Measure correlation between synthetic task performance and real-world robustness.
5. **Human-in-the-Loop Validation**:
• For subjective tasks (e.g., dialogue), conduct large-scale human evaluations to compare benchmark metrics with human judgments.
• Analyze discrepancies to identify limitations of automated metrics (e.g., BLEU for dialogue).

1. Title:
**Towards Robust and Scalable Benchmarks: Addressing Dataset Biases and Evaluation Gaps in Machine Learning**
2. Problem Statement:
Current machine learning benchmarks often suffer from hidden biases, dataset contamination, and evaluation protocols that fail to generalize to real-world scenarios. For instance, widely used datasets like ImageNet and GLUE have been shown to contain annotation artifacts, spurious correlations, and distributional shifts that inflate model performance artificially (Gururangan et al., 2018; Recht et al., 2019). Additionally, benchmark tasks frequently lack diversity in task complexity and domain coverage, leading to overfitting to narrow evaluation settings (Taori et al., 2020). There is a pressing need for benchmarks that systematically address these limitations while maintaining scalability and reproducibility.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the current benchmark ecosystem prioritizes short-term performance gains over long-term robustness, leading to inflated claims of model capabilities. For example, models trained on GLUE often exploit superficial patterns rather than learning genuine linguistic understanding (McCoy et al., 2019). Our central idea is that benchmarks must incorporate (1) controlled adversarial perturbations to test robustness, (2) dynamic task generation to prevent overfitting, and (3) cross-domain evaluation to measure generalization. We believe that by designing benchmarks with these principles, we can better reflect real-world model performance and drive progress toward more generalizable AI systems.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a three-part framework for developing next-generation benchmarks:
(1) **Adversarial Dataset Construction**:
We will introduce controlled perturbations to existing datasets (e.g., text, images) to test model robustness. For text, we will use counterfactual augmentation (Gardner et al., 2020) to generate minimal edits that change label semantics. For images, we will apply domain-specific corruptions (Hendrycks & Dietterich, 2019) to simulate real-world distribution shifts.
(2) **Dynamic Task Generation**:
To prevent overfitting, we will design benchmarks with procedurally generated tasks. For NLP, we will use grammar-based synthesis (Kiela et al., 2021) to create diverse linguistic patterns. For vision, we will leverage procedural graphics engines (Johnson et al., 2017) to generate novel object compositions.
(3) **Cross-Domain Evaluation Protocol**:
We will establish a standardized evaluation protocol where models are tested on unseen domains after training. This includes zero-shot transfer to out-of-distribution datasets (e.g., evaluating on medical texts after training on news corpora) and stress-testing with synthetic adversarial examples.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Benchmark Existing Models on Perturbed Datasets**:
• Apply text perturbations (e.g., synonym swaps, negation insertion) to GLUE and SuperGLUE tasks. Measure performance drop relative to original test sets.
• Evaluate vision models on ImageNet-C (Hendrycks & Dietterich, 2019) and synthetic adversarial variants.
2. **Develop Dynamic Task Generators**:
• For NLP: Implement a grammar-based task generator inspired by Dynabench (Kiela et al., 2021), focusing on compositional generalization.
• For vision: Use Unity-based procedural generation to create object recognition tasks with controlled scene variations.
3. **Train and Evaluate Models on Cross-Domain Tasks**:
• Pretrain models on standard benchmarks (e.g., C4, ImageNet) and evaluate on out-of-domain datasets (e.g., MIMIC-CXR for medical text, iWildCam for wildlife images).
• Compare zero-shot performance against models fine-tuned on in-domain data.
4. **Quantify Robustness and Generalization Gaps**:
• Compute metrics for robustness (e.g., performance under perturbation) and generalization (e.g., cross-domain accuracy drop).
• Analyze failure modes via error attribution (e.g., spurious feature reliance using saliency maps).
5. **Release Open-Source Benchmark Suite**:
• Package datasets, task generators, and evaluation scripts into a unified toolkit.
• Collaborate with MLPerf (Reddi et al., 2020) to integrate our benchmarks into industry-standard evaluation pipelines.

1. Title:
**Advancing AI Evaluation: A Framework for Dynamic, Multi-Dimensional Benchmarking and Dataset Curation**
2. Problem Statement:
Current AI benchmarks and datasets suffer from critical limitations that hinder their ability to accurately measure progress in machine learning. Static benchmarks (e.g., GLUE, SuperGLUE) quickly saturate as models improve, while task-specific datasets (e.g., ImageNet, SQuAD) fail to capture real-world complexity, such as multi-modal reasoning or adversarial robustness. Additionally, dataset biases (e.g., geographic or demographic skews in COCO) perpetuate inequitable model performance. The lack of standardized evaluation protocols for emerging capabilities (e.g., reasoning, long-context understanding) further exacerbates reproducibility challenges. A 2022 study by Kiela et al. (arXiv:2210.09261) highlights that 70% of NLP benchmarks exhibit significant data contamination in pretraining corpora, inflating reported performance.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that a **dynamic, multi-dimensional benchmarking framework**—one that integrates (1) **adaptive difficulty scaling**, (2) **bias-aware dataset curation**, and (3) **cross-modal task composition**—can provide a more rigorous and equitable evaluation of AI systems. Prior work (Ribeiro et al., ACL 2020) shows that models often exploit dataset artifacts rather than learn generalizable patterns. We argue that benchmarks should evolve with model capabilities, akin to "living benchmarks" proposed by Ethayarajh et al. (NeurIPS 2022). Our key insight is that **benchmarks must decouple task difficulty from static datasets** by introducing procedurally generated challenges (e.g., via simulation or synthetic data pipelines) and explicit bias audits.
4. Proposed Method:
**(1) Dynamic Benchmark Design:**
We will develop a **benchmark generator** that synthesizes tasks with tunable complexity, inspired by the Dynabench platform (Kiela et al., 2021). This includes:
- **Controlled adversarial examples** (e.g., counterfactual variants of VQA images from GQA) to test robustness.
- **Procedural task variants** (e.g., programmatically altering narrative coherence in storytelling datasets like ROCStories).
**(2) Bias-Aware Dataset Curation:**
We will formalize a **bias audit protocol** extending the work of Bender et al. (FAccT 2021) and Birhane et al. (NeurIPS 2021). This involves:
- **Intersectional bias metrics** to quantify skews across gender, race, and linguistic dialects (e.g., in speech datasets like LibriSpeech).
- **Data statements** for all new datasets, documenting collection demographics and potential harms.
**(3) Cross-Modal Evaluation:**
We will design **unified benchmarks** for multi-modal tasks (e.g., image-to-text retrieval with compositional reasoning), building on datasets like OK-VQA but with dynamic difficulty. Key innovations include:
- **Latent space perturbations** to test model sensitivity to semantically meaningful variations (e.g., via CLIP-based image transformations).
- **Long-context grounding** tests using synthesized documents (cf. SCROLLS benchmark, Shaham et al., EMNLP 2022).
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Benchmark Saturation Analysis:**
- Quantify saturation rates of 10 major benchmarks (e.g., WMT, SQuAD 2.0) using a meta-analysis of 50+ published model scores.
- *Metric:* Compute the % of benchmarks where top models achieve >95% of estimated human performance.
2. **Dynamic Task Generation:**
- Implement a prototype benchmark generator for NLP (extending Dynabench) and vision (extending CLEVR).
- *Test Case:* Generate 100+ math word problems with procedurally varied linguistic complexity and numerical reasoning depth.
3. **Bias Audits for 5 High-Impact Datasets:**
- Apply intersectional bias metrics to COCO, LibriSpeech, WinoBias, and two genomics datasets (e.g., UK Biobank).
- *Tooling:* Adapt Hugging Face’s `datasets` library to log bias scores during dataset loading.
4. **Cross-Modal Benchmarking:**
- Develop a "stress test" suite combining image, text, and tabular data (e.g., medical QA with paired EHRs and radiology reports).
- *Baselines:* Evaluate CLIP, Flamingo, and GPT-4V on compositional tasks (e.g., "Is the [object] in this image consistent with the caption?").
5. **Longitudinal Evaluation:**
- Deploy our framework in a 6-month model training cycle with 3 labs, tracking performance on dynamic vs. static benchmarks.
- *Success Criteria:* Dynamic benchmarks should show no saturation (perplexity/accuracy improves continuously with compute).

Advancing Dataset and Benchmark Design for Robust Machine Learning Evaluation
2. Problem Statement:
Current machine learning benchmarks often suffer from critical limitations that hinder their ability to reliably measure model performance and generalization. Key issues include: (1) dataset bias and distributional shifts, where models overfit to spurious correlations in training data (Torralba & Efros, 2011); (2) benchmark saturation, where leaderboard performance plateaus despite unresolved real-world challenges (Recht et al., 2019); (3) lack of diversity in task coverage, with overemphasis on narrow domains like image classification (Dodge et al., 2019); and (4) insufficient stress-testing for robustness, fairness, and out-of-distribution generalization (Koh et al., 2021). These limitations create a false sense of progress and obscure fundamental gaps in model capabilities.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that systematic flaws in dataset and benchmark design—particularly the absence of controlled distribution shifts, adversarial perturbations, and fine-grained failure mode analysis—are major contributors to the observed disconnect between benchmark performance and real-world applicability. Drawing on insights from recent work on dataset cartography (Swayamdipta et al., 2020) and challenge sets (Gardner et al., 2020), we posit that a new generation of benchmarks should:
- Explicitly measure robustness through carefully constructed distributional shifts (Taori et al., 2020)
- Incorporate diagnostic tasks that isolate specific capabilities (Ribeiro et al., 2020)
- Use dynamic evaluation protocols that adapt to model strengths/weaknesses (Kiela et al., 2021)
Our central thesis is that such benchmarks will reveal more about model capabilities than traditional static leaderboards.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a three-pronged approach to benchmark innovation:
(1) **Controlled Distribution Shift Framework**:
Building on the WILDS benchmark (Koh et al., 2021), we will develop a taxonomy of distribution shifts (covariate, label, and concept shifts) with quantitative metrics for measuring model sensitivity. Each shift type will be instantiated through carefully curated dataset pairs (e.g., natural vs. synthetic images) with human-verified annotations.
(2) **Diagnostic Challenge Sets**:
Inspired by CheckList (Ribeiro et al., 2020), we will create targeted test suites that probe specific capabilities:
- Compositionality: Can models combine known concepts in novel ways?
- Causal Reasoning: Do models rely on confounding factors?
- Robustness to Negation and Paraphrasing (Naik et al., 2018)
(3) **Dynamic Evaluation Protocol**:
We will design an adaptive testing framework where benchmark difficulty automatically adjusts based on model performance, similar to computerized adaptive testing in education (van der Linden & Glas, 2000). This will prevent ceiling effects while maintaining comparability.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Characterize Current Benchmark Limitations**:
- Conduct meta-analysis of 50+ popular benchmarks using dataset cartography techniques (Swayamdipta et al., 2020)
- Quantify saturation effects by tracking leaderboard progress over time (e.g., GLUE vs. SuperGLUE)
2. **Build Distribution Shift Corpus**:
- Curate 10 controlled shift scenarios per domain (vision, language, etc.)
- Include both natural shifts (e.g., camera angle changes) and synthetic ones (e.g., style transfer)
3. **Develop Diagnostic Tasks**:
- For NLP: Implement 20+ linguistic phenomena tests following the Checklist methodology
- For vision: Create synthetic image variants that isolate texture vs. shape bias (Geirhos et al., 2019)
4. **Validate Dynamic Evaluation**:
- Compare static vs. dynamic evaluation on 5 existing benchmarks
- Measure whether dynamic testing better predicts real-world deployment performance
5. **Large-Scale Benchmarking**:
- Evaluate 10 state-of-the-art models across our new benchmark suite
- Analyze failure modes using influence functions (Koh & Liang, 2017) to identify dataset weaknesses

**Towards Robust and Scalable Benchmarks: Addressing Dataset Biases and Evaluation Gaps in Machine Learning**
2. Problem Statement:
Current machine learning benchmarks often suffer from hidden biases, dataset contamination, and evaluation protocols that fail to generalize to real-world scenarios. For instance, widely used datasets like ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009) and GLUE (Wang et al., 2018) have been criticized for label noise, distributional shifts, and task-specific overfitting (Recht et al., 2019; McCoy et al., 2019). Additionally, benchmark performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, F1-score) may not align with downstream application requirements, leading to misleading conclusions about model capabilities (Blagec et al., 2022). There is a pressing need for benchmarks that are both *scalable* (supporting diverse tasks and modalities) and *robust* (resistant to gaming and overfitting).
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that benchmark reliability can be significantly improved by (1) explicitly modeling and mitigating dataset biases, (2) introducing dynamic evaluation protocols that adapt to model strengths/weaknesses, and (3) incorporating human-in-the-loop validation for critical tasks. Recent work by Koh et al. (2021) demonstrates that even small distribution shifts can drastically degrade model performance, while Gururangan et al. (2022) show that dataset contamination inflates reported results. Our central idea is that *benchmarks should be treated as dynamic, evolving systems* rather than static snapshots, with built-in mechanisms to detect and correct biases over time.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a three-pronged approach to develop next-generation benchmarks:
(1) **Bias-Aware Dataset Construction**:
- Lever techniques from causal inference (Pearl, 2009) to identify and quantify spurious correlations in existing datasets (e.g., using counterfactual augmentation as in Gardner et al., 2021).
- Introduce *adversarial splits* where test sets are explicitly designed to challenge models’ reliance on shortcuts (e.g., texture bias in vision models as shown by Geirhos et al., 2018).
(2) **Dynamic Evaluation Protocols**:
- Design *adaptive benchmarks* where task difficulty scales with model performance, inspired by the Dynabench framework (Kiela et al., 2021).
- Implement *continuous auditing* via model-based anomaly detection (e.g., monitoring for sudden performance jumps indicative of contamination).
(3) **Human-Model Collaboration Metrics**:
- Extend metrics like *HUSE* (human uncertainty-aware evaluation; Hashimoto et al., 2022) to quantify how well models complement human judgment in high-stakes domains (e.g., medical diagnosis).
- Develop *cost-aware evaluation* that accounts for real-world deployment constraints (e.g., latency, annotation cost).
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Quantify Biases in Existing Benchmarks**:
- Audit 5 major datasets (e.g., ImageNet, SQuAD, WMT) using causal discovery tools (e.g., PC algorithm) to identify confounding variables.
- Measure performance drop when models are evaluated on *counterfactual test sets* (e.g., images with altered backgrounds).
2. **Develop and Validate Adversarial Splits**:
- Collaborate with domain experts to create challenge sets for NLP (e.g., negation-heavy examples) and vision (e.g., occluded objects).
- Benchmark 10 SOTA models to establish baselines and identify failure modes.
3. **Test Dynamic Evaluation Protocols**:
- Implement a Dynabench-style platform for text classification, where human annotators iteratively refine tasks based on model weaknesses.
- Compare adaptive vs. static evaluation in terms of robustness (measured by out-of-distribution generalization).

- Analyze trade-offs between fully automated metrics and hybrid human-AI metrics.
5. **Longitudinal Benchmark Maintenance**:
- Deploy a *living benchmark* for climate science (using CMIP6 data; Eyring et al., 2016) with quarterly updates to reflect new research.
- Monitor for concept drift and retrain models to assess stability over time.

**Towards Robust and Scalable Benchmarks: Addressing Dataset Bias and Evaluation Gaps in Machine Learning**
2. Problem Statement:
Current machine learning benchmarks often suffer from dataset bias, lack of diversity, and evaluation protocols that do not reflect real-world deployment conditions. Widely used datasets like ImageNet, GLUE, and WMT have been criticized for their narrow scope, potential biases, and saturation effects, where models achieve near-perfect scores without genuine improvements in generalization (Torralba & Efros, 2011; Kiela et al., 2021). Additionally, benchmarks frequently fail to account for distribution shifts, adversarial robustness, and computational efficiency, leading to overestimation of model capabilities (Recht et al., 2019; Taori et al., 2020). There is a pressing need for benchmarks that are more representative, challenging, and aligned with practical applications.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that current benchmarks inadequately measure model robustness, fairness, and adaptability due to their static nature and homogeneity. For instance, models trained on ImageNet often fail under slight distribution shifts (Barbu et al., 2019), while NLP benchmarks like SuperGLUE may not capture nuanced linguistic understanding (Sakaguchi et al., 2021). We propose that a new generation of benchmarks must incorporate:
- **Diverse and dynamic datasets** to mitigate bias and improve generalization.
- **Multi-dimensional evaluation metrics** that assess robustness, efficiency, and fairness.
- **Real-world deployment scenarios** to bridge the gap between academic research and practical use.
Our central hypothesis is that by systematically addressing these gaps, we can develop benchmarks that better reflect model performance in real-world settings and drive progress toward more robust and generalizable AI systems.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a three-part framework to design and validate next-generation benchmarks:
(1) **Dataset Curation with Bias Mitigation**:
- Leverage techniques from dataset distillation (Sucholutsky & Schonlau, 2021) and adversarial filtering (Zellers et al., 2018) to create datasets that are both diverse and challenging.
- Incorporate synthetic data augmentation (Shorten & Khoshgoftaar, 2019) and domain randomization (Tobin et al., 2017) to simulate real-world variability.
(2) **Multi-Dimensional Evaluation Metrics**:
- Develop metrics that assess robustness (e.g., performance under distribution shifts), efficiency (e.g., FLOPs vs. accuracy trade-offs), and fairness (e.g., demographic parity).
- Introduce dynamic evaluation protocols where test sets evolve over time to prevent overfitting (Liang et al., 2022).
(3) **Benchmark Validation and Scalability**:
- Validate benchmarks through large-scale empirical studies across multiple model architectures (e.g., CNNs, Transformers, SSMs).
- Ensure scalability by designing benchmarks that can grow with advancements in compute and data availability.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Identify Limitations in Existing Benchmarks**:
- Conduct a meta-analysis of popular benchmarks (e.g., ImageNet, GLUE, WMT) to quantify biases and saturation effects.
- Use tools like the "CheckList" framework (Ribeiro et al., 2020) to evaluate model failures on edge cases.
2. **Construct Dynamic and Diverse Datasets**:
- Curate datasets with controlled distribution shifts (e.g., WILDS (Koh et al., 2021)) and adversarial examples (e.g., ImageNet-C (Hendrycks & Dietterich, 2019)).
- Collaborate with domain experts to ensure representativeness (e.g., medical imaging, low-resource languages).

1. Title:
**Advancing Dataset and Benchmark Design for Robust Machine Learning Evaluation**
2. Problem Statement:
Current machine learning benchmarks often suffer from critical limitations that undermine their reliability and generalizability. Many widely used datasets (e.g., ImageNet, GLUE) exhibit biases, annotation artifacts, or distributional mismatches with real-world scenarios, leading to inflated performance metrics that do not translate to practical applications. Additionally, benchmarks frequently lack diversity in task complexity, data modalities, and cultural contexts, limiting their ability to assess model robustness. The rapid pace of model development has outpaced the evolution of evaluation frameworks, creating a pressing need for more rigorous, scalable, and representative benchmarks.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that systematic flaws in dataset and benchmark design—such as narrow task scope, insufficient adversarial testing, and static evaluation protocols—are key contributors to the gap between reported performance and real-world model behavior. Recent work (e.g., Recht et al., 2019 on ImageNet variants) has shown that small distribution shifts can drastically degrade model accuracy, highlighting the fragility of current benchmarks.
Our central hypothesis is that a principled redesign of benchmarks, incorporating (1) dynamic data sampling, (2) multi-dimensional robustness metrics, and (3) task diversity, will yield more reliable evaluations. We propose that models trained and tested on such benchmarks will demonstrate better generalization and fairness across diverse deployment scenarios.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a three-part framework to address these challenges:
(1) **Dynamic Benchmark Construction**:
We will design benchmarks with adaptive data sampling, where test distributions evolve based on model performance. Inspired by the "benchmarking loopholes" identified by Kiela et al. (2021), we will use adversarial filtering techniques to iteratively remove easy examples, forcing models to improve on harder cases. This approach will be applied across modalities (text, vision, audio) to ensure broad applicability.
(2) **Multi-Dimensional Evaluation Metrics**:
Moving beyond aggregate accuracy, we will introduce fine-grained metrics for robustness, including:
- **Cross-Cultural Consistency**: Measuring performance disparities across geographic and demographic subgroups (e.g., using datasets like GeoDE (Shankar et al., 2022)).
- **Temporal Robustness**: Evaluating model drift over time (e.g., on news or social media data with timestamped splits).
- **Adversarial Resistance**: Incorporating stress tests like typographical noise (Ribeiro et al., 2020) and semantic perturbations.
(3) **Task Diversity and Compositionality**:
We will curate benchmarks with hierarchical task complexity, from atomic skills (e.g., coreference resolution) to composite reasoning (e.g., multi-hop QA). This builds on findings from the Beyond the Imitation Game Benchmark (BIG-bench; Srivastava et al., 2022), showing that diverse tasks reveal unexpected model failures.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Identify Benchmark Shortcomings**:
- Conduct a meta-analysis of 10+ popular benchmarks (e.g., WMT, SQuAD, COCO) to quantify biases and gaps using tools like Datasheets (Gebru et al., 2021).

1. Title:
**Towards Robust and Scalable Benchmarks: Addressing Dataset Biases and Evaluation Gaps in Machine Learning**
2. Problem Statement:
Current machine learning benchmarks suffer from critical limitations that hinder progress in the field. First, many widely used datasets (e.g., ImageNet, GLUE) contain inherent biases, annotation artifacts, or distributional shifts that lead to inflated performance metrics and poor generalization in real-world scenarios (Torralba & Efros, 2011; Gururangan et al., 2018). Second, evaluation protocols often lack rigor, with metrics failing to capture nuanced model behaviors (e.g., robustness to adversarial attacks or fairness across subgroups) (Recht et al., 2019; Bender et al., 2021). Third, the rapid emergence of new tasks (e.g., multimodal reasoning, long-context understanding) has outpaced the development of standardized benchmarks, leaving researchers to rely on ad-hoc or non-reproducible evaluations.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that systematic dataset curation and benchmark design can significantly improve model evaluation by:
(1) **Mitigating biases** through rigorous data collection and annotation protocols,
(2) **Enhancing robustness** via stress-testing with synthetic and real-world distribution shifts, and
(3) **Enabling scalability** by designing modular benchmarks that adapt to emerging tasks.
Our central thesis is that a benchmark’s quality is determined not just by its size but by its ability to surface model weaknesses and drive iterative improvement. For example, recent work by Koh et al. (2023) showed that models trained on "debiased" datasets exhibit more consistent out-of-distribution performance, supporting the need for better data practices.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a three-pronged approach to benchmark development:
(1) **Bias-Aware Dataset Curation**:
- Leverage techniques from causal inference (Pearl, 2009) to identify and mitigate confounding variables in existing datasets.
- Introduce synthetic data augmentation (e.g., counterfactual examples (Gardner et al., 2021)) to balance underrepresented groups.
- Collaborate with domain experts to annotate fine-grained labels (e.g., for fairness evaluations (Buolamwini & Gebru, 2018)).
(2) **Dynamic Evaluation Protocols**:
- Design multi-dimensional metrics that assess not just accuracy but also robustness (e.g., via adversarial perturbations (Hendrycks & Dietterich, 2019)) and efficiency (e.g., inference latency per token).
- Implement "hidden" test sets updated periodically to prevent overfitting (like Dynabench (Kiela et al., 2021)).
(3) **Benchmark Infrastructure for Long-Tail Tasks**:
- Build a modular framework inspired by EleutherAI’s LM Evaluation Harness (Gao et al., 2023), allowing researchers to add new tasks without reinventing evaluation pipelines.
- Incorporate real-world deployment constraints (e.g., memory footprint, energy consumption) into scoring criteria.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Audit Existing Benchmarks**:
- Quantify biases in 5 widely used datasets (e.g., COCO, SQuAD) using statistical parity and counterfactual fairness metrics (Kusner et al., 2017).
- Re-annotate subsets with crowdworkers to measure inter-annotator disagreement (Pavlick & Kwiatkowski, 2019).
2. **Develop Synthetic Stress Tests**:
- Generate adversarial examples via TextAttack (Morris et al., 2020) and image corruptions via ImageNet-C (Hendrycks & Dietterich, 2019).
- Measure performance drops across 10 SOTA models to identify failure modes.
3. **Pilot New Annotation Protocols**:
- Collaborate with linguists and ethicists to design guidelines for culturally inclusive data labeling (e.g., for hate speech detection (Sap et al., 2022)).
- Compare model performance on expert-annotated vs. crowdworker-annotated data.
4. **Validate Scalability**:
- Deploy our modular benchmark framework on 3 emerging tasks (e.g., AI safety, embodied agents).
- Track adoption rates and researcher feedback via surveys.
5. **Longitudinal Evaluation**:
- Monitor 20 models trained on our benchmarks over 12 months to assess real-world generalization.
- Publish leaderboards with dynamic updates to reflect evolving standards.

Towards Foundational Datasets and Benchmarks: Addressing Gaps in Evaluation for General-Purpose AI Systems
2. Problem Statement:
Current AI evaluation relies heavily on narrow, task-specific benchmarks (e.g., GLUE for NLP, ImageNet for vision) that fail to capture the capabilities and limitations of general-purpose AI systems. These benchmarks suffer from three critical flaws: (1) **Static Nature**: Fixed datasets lead to overfitting and fail to adapt to evolving model capabilities (Kiela et al., 2021); (2) **Task Isolation**: Most benchmarks evaluate single modalities or skills, ignoring cross-domain reasoning (Liang et al., 2022); (3) **Metric Misalignment**: Proxy metrics (e.g., accuracy) often poorly correlate with real-world performance (Blagec et al., 2022). Without foundational datasets and dynamic evaluation frameworks, progress toward robust, general AI is hindered.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that a new class of **foundational datasets**—designed for adaptability, multi-modal integration, and metric diversity—can close the gap between narrow benchmarks and general AI evaluation. Key insights:
- **Dynamic Evaluation**: Benchmarks should evolve with models to prevent saturation (Zellers et al., 2019).
- **Cross-Domain Tasks**: Combining language, vision, and reasoning (e.g., MMMU by Yue et al., 2024) better reflects real-world complexity.
- **Human-AI Collaboration**: Incorporating human-in-the-loop metrics (e.g., usefulness, trust) aligns evaluation with deployment needs (Ethayarajh & Jurafsky, 2024).
Our central hypothesis: A benchmark framework with these properties will expose weaknesses in general-purpose AI more effectively than current static benchmarks.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a three-part methodology to design and validate foundational datasets and benchmarks:
(1) **Dynamic Dataset Construction**:
- Leverage generative models (e.g., GPT-4, Stable Diffusion) to create synthetic but realistic test cases that adapt to model strengths (similar to Dynabench by Kiela et al., 2021).
- Implement a "benchmark-in-the-loop" system where failed examples are iteratively refined to target model weaknesses.
(2) **Multi-Modal Task Integration**:
- Design tasks requiring joint reasoning across text, images, and structured data (inspired by M3Exam by Zhang et al., 2023).
- Introduce "compositional" tasks where solving subtasks in isolation is insufficient (e.g., visual question answering with implicit reasoning).
(3) **Holistic Metric Design**:
- Combine traditional metrics (accuracy, F1) with human evaluations (e.g., via scalable crowdsourcing pipelines).
- Incorporate efficiency metrics (e.g., energy consumption per inference) to address sustainability concerns (Schwartz et al., 2020).
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Benchmark Existing Models on Proposed Tasks**:
- Evaluate state-of-the-art models (e.g., GPT-4, Claude, Gemini) on initial dynamic datasets to establish baselines.
- Measure performance gaps in cross-domain tasks (e.g., text-to-image reasoning) versus single-modality performance.
2. **Iterative Dataset Refinement**:
- Use model failures to generate adversarial examples (e.g., counterfactuals via LLMs).
- Validate dataset quality with human annotators to ensure realism and difficulty.
3. **Cross-Domain Generalization Tests**:
- Train models on mixed-modal data (e.g., LAION-5B + The Pile) and evaluate zero-shot transfer to novel tasks.
- Compare to single-modality training to quantify the "compositionality gap."
4. **Human-AI Evaluation**:
- Deploy tasks via platforms like Mechanical Turk to collect human ratings on output quality, coherence, and usefulness.
- Correlate human judgments with automated metrics to identify misalignments.
5. **Longitudinal Benchmarking**:
- Track model performance over 12 months as datasets evolve, measuring progress saturation.
- Publish a leaderboard with multi-dimensional rankings (accuracy, efficiency, human ratings).

Benchmarking Beyond Scale: A Framework for Evaluating Dataset Quality, Diversity, and Bias in Machine Learning
2. Problem Statement:
Current machine learning benchmarks prioritize scale and task performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, F1-score) while neglecting critical dimensions of dataset quality, such as representational diversity, label consistency, and systemic biases. Widely used benchmarks like GLUE (Wang et al., 2018) and ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009) have been criticized for annotation artifacts (Gururangan et al., 2018), geographic skew (Shankar et al., 2017), and limited coverage of edge cases (Barbu et al., 2019). This creates a misalignment between benchmark performance and real-world robustness, as models optimized for these datasets often fail under distribution shifts (Taori et al., 2020). A systematic framework for auditing and improving dataset quality is urgently needed.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that dataset quality metrics—such as label noise rates, diversity indices, and bias propagation scores—are stronger predictors of real-world model performance than scale alone. Prior work has shown that even small, carefully curated datasets (e.g., CIFAR-10) can outperform larger but noisier counterparts (Northcutt et al., 2021). Our central idea is that a multi-dimensional benchmarking framework, incorporating:
(1) Statistical quality (e.g., inter-annotator agreement, outlier detection)
(2) Diversity (e.g., demographic coverage, concept balance)
(3) Bias propagation (e.g., measuring spurious correlation strength via methods like JUST (Wang & Russakovsky, 2021))
will enable more reliable model evaluation and dataset construction.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a three-part methodology:
(1) Quality Auditing Toolkit:
• Develop automated checks for label consistency using confusion matrices and clustering-based outlier detection (e.g., extending CleanLab (Northcutt et al., 2021)).
• Quantify diversity via entropy-based metrics across metadata dimensions (e.g., geolocation, time periods) and latent space coverage (using PCA/KL-divergence).
(2) Bias Measurement Pipeline:
• Adapt causal discovery tools (e.g., DECI (Geffner et al., 2022)) to identify spurious features correlated with labels.
• Introduce "bias amplification scores" measuring how dataset biases affect model predictions on held-out balanced subsets.
(3) Dynamic Benchmarking Protocol:
• Design a benchmark where datasets are ranked by quality/diversity scores rather than size.
• Incorporate stress tests (e.g., adversarial patches (Brown et al., 2022), synthetic distribution shifts) to evaluate robustness.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. Audit Existing Benchmarks:
• Apply our toolkit to 10 major datasets (e.g., WILDS (Koh et al., 2021), LAION-5B (Schuhmann et al., 2022)).
• Publish quality scorecards highlighting gaps (e.g., "90% of COCO’s images are from North America").
2. Controlled Dataset Experiments:
• Create synthetic datasets with known bias levels (varying spurious correlation strength from 0.1 to 0.9).
• Train models and measure how bias scores predict OOD performance drops.
3. Diversity-Performance Correlation Study:
• Subsample ImageNet with stratified sampling (by country, scene type) to create balanced variants.
• Compare ResNet-50 accuracy on original vs. balanced versions to isolate diversity effects.
4. Real-World Deployment Validation:
• Partner with 3 organizations to test our framework on medical imaging (CheXpert (Irvin et al., 2019)) and satellite datasets.
• Evaluate if quality scores predict model failure rates in production.
5. Benchmarking Infrastructure:
• Release open-source tools for computing quality metrics (Python package with PyTorch integration).
• Propose a leaderboard where submissions must report diversity/bias metrics alongside accuracy.

Advancing AI Evaluation: A Framework for Dynamic, Multi-Dimensional Benchmarking and Dataset Curation
2. Problem Statement:
Current AI benchmarks and datasets suffer from critical limitations that hinder their ability to accurately measure progress in machine learning. First, static benchmarks quickly become saturated, as models overfit to fixed test sets (Recht et al., 2019). Second, most benchmarks evaluate narrow capabilities in isolation (e.g., image classification accuracy on ImageNet) rather than assessing multi-dimensional reasoning (Hendrycks et al., 2021). Third, dataset quality issues—such as labeling errors, biases, and distributional mismatches—compromise reliability (Northcutt et al., 2021). These limitations create a misalignment between benchmark performance and real-world utility, slowing progress toward robust AI systems.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that a dynamic, multi-dimensional benchmarking framework can better capture model capabilities and generalize to real-world scenarios. Prior work has shown that adaptive testing (Deng et al., 2022) and compositional evaluation (Bisk et al., 2020) improve robustness, but no unified solution exists. Our key insight is that benchmarks should: (1) evolve dynamically to prevent overfitting, (2) integrate cross-domain tasks to measure compositional reasoning, and (3) incorporate rigorous dataset auditing to mitigate quality issues. We predict that such a framework will reveal capability gaps more accurately than static benchmarks, enabling targeted improvements in model development.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a three-part framework for next-generation benchmarking:
(1) **Dynamic Benchmark Construction**:
We will develop a benchmark generation system that dynamically samples tasks and data splits based on model performance. Inspired by Recht et al. (2019), we will use adversarial filtering to create "test suites" that adaptively challenge models where they are weakest. This will prevent saturation and encourage generalization.
(2) **Multi-Dimensional Evaluation Protocol**:
Building on Bisk et al. (2020), we will design a hierarchical evaluation protocol that measures capabilities across domains (e.g., vision, language, reasoning) and difficulty levels. Tasks will require compositional reasoning (e.g., visual question answering with implicit knowledge) to assess emergent abilities. We will integrate metrics from Hendrycks et al. (2021) for robustness and fairness.
(3) **Dataset Quality Assurance Pipeline**:
To address dataset issues, we will implement an automated auditing pipeline combining:
- Label error detection (Northcutt et al., 2021)
- Bias quantification (Buolamwini & Gebru, 2018)
- Distribution shift analysis (Koh et al., 2021)
This pipeline will be open-sourced to enable community-wide dataset improvements.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Benchmark Dynamic Adaptation Validation**:
- Test adversarial filtering on ImageNet variants (Recht et al., 2019) to verify that dynamic benchmarks reduce overfitting.
- Measure generalization gap between static and dynamic evaluation on held-out tasks.
2. **Multi-Dimensional Capability Assessment**:
- Train models on our hierarchical benchmark and compare performance to single-task baselines.
- Analyze correlations between sub-capabilities (e.g., spatial reasoning vs. language understanding) to identify bottlenecks.
3. **Dataset Auditing Impact Study**:
- Apply our quality assurance pipeline to popular datasets (e.g., COCO, GLUE).
- Quantify performance changes when models are trained on "cleaned" vs. original data (Northcutt et al., 2021).
4. **Real-World Utility Evaluation**:
- Deploy models optimized for our benchmark in practical applications (e.g., healthcare diagnostics, autonomous driving).
- Compare task performance against models optimized for traditional benchmarks.
5. **Community Adoption Analysis**:
- Release our framework as an open-source toolkit.
- Track adoption and extensions by third-party researchers to assess scalability and impact.

**Benchmarking Beyond Scale: A Framework for Evaluating Dataset Quality and Model Generalization in Limited-Data Regimes**
2. Problem Statement:
Current AI benchmarking practices disproportionately emphasize large-scale datasets (e.g., ImageNet, The Pile) and compute-heavy training regimes, which fail to address critical challenges in low-resource domains (medical imaging, endangered language processing) or scenarios where data collection is expensive or ethically constrained (e.g., clinical trials). Existing benchmarks often conflate performance metrics with generalization, neglecting dataset artifacts (e.g., label biases, spurious correlations) that inflate model performance without true understanding. For instance, studies like Recht et al. (2019) demonstrated that models trained on ImageNet achieve high accuracy on its test set but fail on carefully controlled variants, revealing brittleness. There is no systematic framework to evaluate dataset quality (e.g., diversity, bias, task alignment) or measure generalization beyond held-out test splits.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that current benchmarking practices overfit to "easy" data regimes and fail to stress-test models’ ability to generalize under distribution shifts or limited supervision. Our central thesis is that dataset quality—measured through rigorous statistical and semantic audits—is a stronger predictor of real-world model robustness than scale alone. Drawing from recent work on dataset cartography (Swayamdipta et al., 2020) and challenge sets (Gardner et al., 2020), we propose that benchmarking should prioritize:
- **Task-Data Alignment**: Quantifying whether dataset features match the intended cognitive task (e.g., diagnosing pneumonia from X-rays vs. detecting scanner artifacts).
- **Bias Propagation**: Measuring how dataset biases (e.g., racial/gender skews in facial recognition data) translate to model failures.
- **Generalization Gradients**: Evaluating performance decay under controlled perturbations (e.g., synthetic corruptions, adversarial edits).
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a three-part framework to redefine benchmarking:
(1) **Dataset Auditing Toolkit**: Develop automated metrics to quantify dataset quality across dimensions:
- **Diversity**: Adapting entropy-based measures from ecology (Simpson’s index) to feature space (e.g., CLIP embeddings for images).
- **Bias Detection**: Extending techniques like FairFace (Karkkainen & Joo, 2021) to audit label distributions and feature correlations.
- **Artifact Robustness**: Implementing synthetic perturbations (e.g., texture randomization for images, synonym swaps for text) to isolate spurious features.
(2) **Generalization Benchmarks**: Curate challenge sets for high-stakes domains:
- **Medical Imaging**: Partner with NIH to create "MedShift," a controlled benchmark with procedurally generated pathologies (following Padhy et al., 2022).
- **Low-Resource NLP**: Collaborate with endangered language communities to build "LinguaZero," a benchmark with ≤100 training examples per language.
(3) **Metric Standardization**: Propose a unified scoring system, the **Generalization Robustness Score (GRS)**, combining:
- **In-Distribution (ID) Accuracy**: Standard test-set performance.
- **Out-of-Distribution (OOD) Delta**: Performance drop on curated challenge sets.
- **Bias Amplification Factor (BAF)**: Ratio of error rates across demographic subgroups.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Audit Existing Benchmarks**:
- Apply our toolkit to 10 major datasets (e.g., CIFAR-10, GLUE, CheXpert).
- Publish a "Data Health Report" highlighting biases (e.g., label leakage in MNIST) and spurious features (e.g., background correlations in CelebA).
2. **Validate GRS with Controlled Studies**:
- Train 50 models on datasets with known artifacts (e.g., Camelyon17 with hospital biases).
- Correlate GRS with real-world deployment outcomes (using clinical trial data from Irvin et al., 2019).
3. **Build MedShift and LinguaZero**:
- Generate 10,000 synthetic medical images with paired metadata (age, scanner type).
- Crowdsource translations for 5 endangered languages via community partnerships.
4. **Benchmark State-of-the-Art Models**:
- Test GPT-4, LLaMA-3, and ResNet-152 on our benchmarks.
- Compare GRS rankings against traditional leaderboards (e.g., GLUE, ImageNet Top-1).
5. **Ablation Studies**:
- Vary dataset size (1% to 100% subsets) to isolate quality-vs-scale tradeoffs.
- Test metric sensitivity by incrementally adding biases (e.g., injecting gender skews into facial recognition data).

**Advancing AI Evaluation: A Framework for Dynamic, Multi-Dimensional Benchmarking and Dataset Curation**
2. Problem Statement:
Current AI benchmarks and datasets suffer from critical limitations that hinder accurate model evaluation. First, static benchmarks (e.g., GLUE, SuperGLUE) fail to adapt to evolving real-world challenges, leading to overfitting and inflated performance metrics (Raffel et al., 2020). Second, datasets often lack diversity in task complexity, modalities, and cultural contexts, resulting in biased evaluations (Bender et al., 2021). Third, benchmarks rarely measure computational efficiency, robustness to distribution shifts, or ethical considerations (Kiela et al., 2021). These gaps create a misalignment between reported performance and real-world applicability, necessitating a paradigm shift in benchmarking methodology.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that a dynamic, multi-dimensional benchmarking framework can bridge this gap by:
- **Adaptivity**: Continuously evolving tasks to prevent overfitting, inspired by curriculum learning (Bengio et al., 2009).
- **Holistic Evaluation**: Incorporating metrics for robustness, fairness, and efficiency alongside accuracy (Ethayarajh & Jurafsky, 2021).
- **Real-World Relevance**: Emphasizing tasks with practical implications, such as handling noisy or incomplete data (Gardner et al., 2023).
Our central hypothesis is that such a framework will reveal hidden model weaknesses, better correlate with deployment performance, and incentivize research toward more generalizable AI systems.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a three-part methodology:
**(1) Dynamic Benchmark Design**:
- Develop a **self-updating benchmark** where tasks are periodically replaced or modified based on model performance saturation, using techniques from adversarial data collection (Dinan et al., 2021).
- Introduce **progressive difficulty tiers**, requiring models to generalize from simple to complex scenarios (e.g., from clean text to multimodal, noisy inputs).
**(2) Multi-Dimensional Metrics**:
- Expand evaluation beyond accuracy to include:
- **Robustness**: Performance under distribution shifts (Taori et al., 2020).
- **Efficiency**: FLOPs, memory usage, and latency (Schwartz et al., 2020).
- **Fairness**: Bias detection across demographic groups (Blodgett et al., 2020).
**(3) Automated Dataset Curation**:
- Leverage LLMs to generate diverse, high-quality synthetic data for underrepresented tasks (e.g., low-resource languages), validated by human annotators (Kreutzer et al., 2022).
- Implement **data audits** to identify and mitigate biases using techniques like counterfactual augmentation (Gardner et al., 2023).

- Curate a pilot benchmark with 10 tasks spanning NLP, vision, and multimodal domains.
- For each task, define 3 difficulty tiers (e.g., clean data → noisy data → adversarial examples).
- Partner with platforms like Dynabench to enable dynamic updates (Dinan et al., 2021).
2. **Baseline Evaluation**:

- Measure performance degradation across tiers to identify robustness gaps.
3. **Metric Validation**:
- Correlate benchmark scores with real-world deployment outcomes (e.g., user satisfaction, error rates) using industry partnerships.
- Conduct ablation studies to determine which metrics best predict practical utility.
4. **Longitudinal Study**:

**Towards Robust and Scalable Benchmarks: Addressing Dataset Biases and Evaluation Gaps in Machine Learning**
2. Problem Statement:
Current machine learning benchmarks often suffer from hidden biases, dataset contamination, and evaluation protocols that fail to generalize to real-world scenarios. For instance, widely used datasets like ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009) and GLUE (Wang et al., 2018) have been criticized for label noise, distributional shifts, and task-specific overfitting (Recht et al., 2019; McCoy et al., 2019). Additionally, benchmark performance often fails to translate to downstream applications due to mismatched evaluation metrics or lack of diversity in data (Torralba & Efros, 2011). There is a pressing need for benchmarks that are both *scalable* (supporting large-scale model training) and *robust* (resistant to shortcuts and adversarial exploitation).
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that many benchmark shortcomings stem from three key issues: (1) *static evaluation*, where test sets are fixed and models can overfit to them (Zellers et al., 2021); (2) *task granularity*, where benchmarks oversimplify real-world complexity (e.g., single-label classification vs. multi-modal reasoning); and (3) *data provenance*, where datasets lack transparency in collection and annotation (Paullada et al., 2021).
Our central idea is that *dynamic*, *compositional*, and *auditable* benchmarks can mitigate these issues. By introducing benchmarks that evolve over time, require compositional reasoning, and provide detailed data lineage, we aim to close the gap between benchmark performance and real-world utility.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a three-pronged approach to benchmark design:
(1) **Dynamic Benchmarking Framework**: Inspired by Dynabench (Kiela et al., 2021), we will develop a platform where test sets are periodically updated via adversarial human-in-the-loop challenges. This prevents models from "gaming" static evaluations.
(2) **Compositional Task Design**: Drawing from work in procedural generation (Cobbe et al., 2020), we will create benchmarks where tasks require combining multiple skills (e.g., vision + language + reasoning) in novel ways, reducing the risk of narrow overfitting.
(3) **Data Provenance Tracking**: Leveraging dataset transparency tools like Datasheets (Gebru et al., 2021), we will enforce strict metadata standards for all benchmark data, including annotation protocols, demographic diversity, and potential biases.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Identify Benchmark Shortcomings**:
• Conduct a meta-analysis of 10+ popular benchmarks (e.g., SQuAD, WMT) to quantify biases and evaluation gaps using methods from Paullada et al. (2021).
• Synthesize failure modes (e.g., annotation artifacts, distributional shifts) into a taxonomy.
2. **Develop Dynamic Evaluation Prototypes**:
• Implement a Dynabench-style adversarial pipeline for NLP tasks, where humans interactively "break" model predictions.
• Measure the gap between static and dynamic evaluation performance on models like BERT and GPT-3.
3. **Test Compositional Generalization**:
• Design a benchmark with procedurally generated tasks (e.g., math word problems requiring multi-step reasoning).
• Evaluate whether models trained on static benchmarks fail to generalize, as shown by Keysers et al. (2020).
4. **Audit Real-World Transfer**:
• Partner with industry to deploy benchmark-trained models in production settings (e.g., customer support chatbots).
• Compare benchmark metrics (e.g., accuracy) to operational metrics (e.g., user satisfaction).
5. **Quantify Scalability vs. Robustness Tradeoffs**:

1. Title:
**Towards Robust and Scalable Benchmarks: Addressing Dataset Biases and Evaluation Gaps in Machine Learning**
2. Problem Statement:
Current machine learning benchmarks often suffer from hidden biases, dataset artifacts, and evaluation protocols that do not reflect real-world generalization. For example, many NLP datasets contain spurious correlations that models exploit to achieve high scores without true understanding (Gururangan et al., 2018). Similarly, computer vision benchmarks like ImageNet exhibit label noise and geographic biases (Shankar et al., 2017). These issues undermine the reliability of progress measurements and hinder the development of models that generalize robustly. Additionally, benchmarks for emerging domains (e.g., multimodal reasoning or long-context tasks) lack standardized evaluation frameworks, making comparisons difficult.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that systematic dataset auditing and the design of bias-resistant benchmarks can significantly improve the reliability of model evaluation. Our central idea is that by (1) identifying and mitigating dataset artifacts, (2) introducing controlled adversarial perturbations, and (3) developing task suites that measure compositional generalization, we can create benchmarks that better reflect real-world performance. For instance, recent work by Ribeiro et al. (2020) shows that adversarial filtering can reduce superficial patterns in NLP datasets. We extend this idea to multimodal and long-context tasks, where biases are less studied.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a three-part framework for robust benchmark design:
(1) **Dataset Auditing and Debiasing**:
We will develop automated tools to detect spurious correlations and label noise using techniques like influence functions (Koh & Liang, 2017) and counterfactual augmentation (Gardner et al., 2021). For multimodal data, we will extend these methods to cross-modal biases (e.g., text-image misalignment in datasets like COCO).
(2) **Controlled Perturbation Benchmarks**:
Inspired by CheckList (Ribeiro et al., 2020), we will create task-specific perturbation suites (e.g., synonym swaps, spatial transformations, or temporal shuffles) to test invariance properties. For long-context tasks, we will introduce "needle-in-the-haystack" probes (similar to Rae et al., 2020) to evaluate information retrieval over extended sequences.
(3) **Compositional Generalization Tasks**:
We will design benchmarks that require models to combine known concepts in novel ways, building on SCAN (Lake & Baroni, 2018) and CFQ (Keysers et al., 2020). For example, we will create splits where test examples recombine training primitives in unseen configurations.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Audit Existing Benchmarks**:
• Apply influence functions to identify biased examples in GLUE (Wang et al., 2019) and ImageNet.
• Quantify geographic bias using geotagged metadata (e.g., DollarStreet dataset from Shankar et al., 2017).
2. **Develop Debiasing Tools**:
• Train models on subsets with artifacts removed and measure performance drop on original test sets.
• Compare adversarial filtering (Ribeiro et al., 2020) vs. counterfactual augmentation (Gardner et al., 2021) for NLP and vision tasks.
3. **Build Perturbation Suites**:
• For NLP: Introduce lexical, syntactic, and semantic perturbations (e.g., negation insertion).
• For vision: Test robustness to occlusions, lighting changes, and adversarial patches (Brown et al., 2018).
4. **Evaluate on Compositional Tasks**:
• Train models on SCAN-like splits and measure accuracy on held-out compositions.

**Advancing Dataset and Benchmark Design for Robust AI Evaluation: Addressing Bias, Scalability, and Real-World Generalization**
2. Problem Statement:
Current AI benchmarks and datasets suffer from critical limitations that hinder their ability to reliably measure progress in machine learning. First, many widely used benchmarks (e.g., ImageNet, GLUE) exhibit dataset bias, where models overfit to superficial patterns rather than learning robust features, as shown by [1]. Second, benchmarks often lack scalability to real-world complexity, failing to capture long-tail distributions or multimodal interactions [2]. Third, evaluation protocols are frequently static, lacking adaptive mechanisms to detect shortcuts or adversarial vulnerabilities [3]. Finally, there is a growing disconnect between academic benchmarks and real-world deployment scenarios, where models face dynamic, noisy, and evolving data distributions [4].
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that these limitations stem from three root causes: (1) insufficient diversity in dataset construction, (2) rigid evaluation protocols that do not evolve with model capabilities, and (3) a lack of systematic stress-testing for generalization under distribution shifts. Recent work by [5] demonstrates that even small perturbations to benchmark data can drastically alter model rankings, suggesting that current benchmarks are brittle.
Our central hypothesis is that a new generation of benchmarks can be designed to explicitly address these gaps by:
- Incorporating **dynamic evaluation** where test sets evolve to counter overfitting (inspired by [6]).
- Embedding **controlled synthetic biases** to measure robustness (extending [7]).
- Introducing **multi-faceted metrics** that go beyond average accuracy to assess fairness, efficiency, and adaptability (building on [8]).
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a three-part framework for next-generation dataset and benchmark design:
(1) **Bias-Aware Dataset Construction**:
We will develop a data generation pipeline that systematically injects and controls for biases (e.g., spurious correlations, demographic skews) using synthetic data augmentation techniques from [9]. This will enable precise measurement of model sensitivity to specific bias types.
(2) **Dynamic Benchmarking Protocol**:
Drawing from [10], we will design an adversarial benchmark framework where test cases are iteratively updated based on model weaknesses detected in prior evaluations. This "red teaming" approach will use LLM-generated edge cases to probe failures.
(3) **Generalization Stress Testing**:
We will create a suite of cross-domain transfer tasks, where models trained on one benchmark (e.g., vision) are evaluated on semantically related but distributionally distinct tasks (e.g., sketch recognition), extending the methodology of [11].
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Characterize Benchmark Limitations**:
- Audit 10 major benchmarks (e.g., WILDS, HELM) for diversity gaps using the bias detection tools from [12].
- Quantify shortcut learning via diagnostic classifiers (following [13]).
2. **Build Synthetic Bias Testbeds**:
- Generate datasets with known confounding variables (e.g., texture bias in vision) using the procedural methods of [14].
- Measure how SOTA models (e.g., CLIP, Llama) exploit these biases via ablation studies.
3. **Implement Dynamic Evaluation**:
- Develop an LLM-based test case generator (building on [15]) that creates adversarial examples targeting model weaknesses.
- Benchmark 5 leading models iteratively, updating test cases after each round.
4. **Cross-Domain Generalization Tests**:
- Curate a "meta-benchmark" of 20+ tasks with controlled distribution shifts (e.g., synthetic→real images), adapting the framework of [16].
- Evaluate whether improvements on static benchmarks correlate with cross-domain performance.
5. **Metric Development & Validation**:
- Propose new composite metrics (e.g., "robustness-adjusted accuracy") that combine traditional scores with bias sensitivity measures.
- Validate metrics via human evaluation studies to ensure alignment with real-world utility [17].

**Benchmarking Beyond Scale: Towards High-Quality, Diverse, and Explainable Evaluation Datasets for AI Systems**
2. Problem Statement:
Current AI benchmarks heavily prioritize scale (e.g., large token counts, massive image corpora) and narrow task-specific performance (e.g., accuracy on GLUE, ImageNet), often at the expense of dataset quality, diversity, and real-world applicability. Three critical gaps persist:
- **Quality Degradation**: Many widely used datasets (e.g., LAION-5B) contain significant noise, biases, or labeling errors, undermining model reliability (Birhane et al., 2021).
- **Diversity Shortfalls**: Benchmarks lack representation of low-resource languages, cultural contexts, and edge cases, leading to brittle generalization (Rudinger et al., 2020).
- **Explainability Gaps**: Few benchmarks assess *how* models arrive at answers (e.g., faithfulness of rationales), limiting interpretability (Wiegreffe et al., 2022).
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that **curating smaller, high-quality datasets with explicit diversity controls and explainability requirements** will yield more robust and generalizable AI systems than scaling alone. Our key insights:
- **Quality Over Quantity**: Noise-filtered subsets (e.g., DataComp’s "medium" filter) can outperform larger but noisier datasets (Gadre et al., 2023).
- **Diversity-Driven Generalization**: Explicit stratification by language, dialect, and cultural context (e.g., MasakhaNER for African languages) improves cross-domain performance (Adelani et al., 2021).
- **Explainability as a Metric**: Benchmarks like ERASER (DeYoung et al., 2020) show that evaluating rationale coherence can detect spurious correlations.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a three-part framework for next-generation benchmarks:
**(1) Quality-Centric Dataset Construction**:
- Develop *dynamic filtering pipelines* combining automated (e.g., CLIP-based outlier detection) and human-in-the-loop verification (e.g., MTurk for text).
- Integrate *provenance tracking* to document data sources and transformations (e.g., Datasheets for Datasets, Gebru et al., 2021).
**(2) Diversity-Aware Sampling**:
- Use *stratified sampling* to ensure coverage of linguistic, geographic, and demographic variables (e.g., extending BLOOM’s multilingual approach (Muennighoff et al., 2023)).
- Incorporate *synthetic edge cases* via controlled perturbations (e.g., counterfactual augmentations for fairness testing (Gardner et al., 2020)).
**(3) Explainability-Integrated Evaluation**:
- Extend benchmarks like SuperGLUE with *rationale-annotated subsets* (e.g., requiring models to highlight evidence for QA tasks).
- Introduce *faithfulness metrics* (e.g., consistency between model attention and human annotations (Jain & Wallace, 2019)).
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Audit Existing Benchmarks**:
- Quantify noise/bias in 3 major datasets (LAION-5B, The Pile, WMT) using:
• *Label error rates* (Northcutt et al., 2021’s confident learning).
• *Representation gaps* (e.g., % of African languages in mC4).
2. **Build Quality-Filtered Subsets**:
- Apply dynamic filtering to create "clean" versions of LAION-5B and The Pile.
- Benchmark LLaMA-3 and GPT-4 on original vs. filtered data to isolate quality impact.
3. **Diversity-Enhanced Benchmarking**:
- Extend XNLI to include 10 additional low-resource languages via professional translation.
- Evaluate mT5’s performance on stratified vs. random test splits.
4. **Explainability-Centric Tasks**:
- Annotate 5K examples from StrategyQA with human rationales.
- Measure correlation between model accuracy and rationale faithfulness (ERASER protocol).
5. **Longitudinal Real-World Testing**:
- Deploy models trained on our benchmarks in production settings (e.g., healthcare chatbots).
- Track failure modes tied to dataset gaps (e.g., dialect misunderstandings).

Advancing Dataset and Benchmark Design for Robust AI Evaluation
2. Problem Statement:
Current AI benchmarks suffer from critical limitations that hinder reliable model evaluation. Many widely used datasets (e.g., ImageNet, GLUE) exhibit biases, annotation artifacts, and distributional mismatches with real-world scenarios, leading to inflated performance metrics that do not generalize (Recht et al., 2019; Gururangan et al., 2018). Additionally, benchmarks often lack diversity in task complexity, failing to probe nuanced capabilities like reasoning under distribution shifts or long-tail generalization (Koh et al., 2021). The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) has further exposed gaps in evaluation protocols, with many benchmarks becoming saturated or susceptible to data contamination (Srivastava et al., 2023). There is an urgent need for principled dataset and benchmark design methodologies that address these shortcomings.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that current benchmark shortcomings stem from three root causes: (1) insufficient emphasis on adversarial or out-of-distribution (OOD) examples during dataset construction, (2) lack of systematic frameworks for measuring and mitigating dataset biases, and (3) over-reliance on static benchmarks that do not evolve with model capabilities.
Our central idea is that a new generation of benchmarks should incorporate:
- **Controlled synthetic data** to isolate specific capabilities (e.g., Dyckbench for hierarchical reasoning; Ettinger, 2020)
- **Dynamic adversarial filtering** to continuously eliminate "easy" examples (Kiela et al., 2021)
- **Multi-dimensional evaluation** that separates robustness, efficiency, and fairness metrics (Ethayarajh & Jurafsky, 2021)
We predict that such benchmarks will reveal more accurate performance gaps between models and drive progress toward robust AI systems.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a three-part methodology for next-generation benchmark design:
(1) **Bias-Aware Dataset Construction**:
- Develop a taxonomy of common dataset biases (e.g., lexical overlap in QA, spurious correlations in vision) based on prior work (Geirhos et al., 2020)
- Implement bias quantification tools (e.g., influence functions to identify problematic examples; Koh & Liang, 2017)
- Introduce synthetic data augmentation with controlled perturbations (e.g., counterfactual image edits; Gokhale et al., 2022)
(2) **Dynamic Benchmarking Framework**:
- Extend the Dynabench platform (Kiela et al., 2021) with model-in-the-loop adversarial filtering
- Design "benchmark batteries" that combine static (fixed test sets) and dynamic (adaptive) components
- Integrate efficiency metrics (FLOPs, memory) alongside accuracy (Ding et al., 2021)
(3) **Evaluation Protocol Standardization**:
- Propose guidelines for reporting data contamination checks (e.g., n-gram overlap with training data; Elangovan et al., 2021)
- Develop a robustness score aggregating performance across OOD splits (Taori et al., 2020)
- Release an open-source toolkit for benchmark creation with pre-registration support
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Characterize Limitations of Existing Benchmarks**:
- Audit 10 major benchmarks (e.g., SQuAD, WILDS) for annotation artifacts using methods from Gururangan et al. (2018)
- Measure OOD performance drops using curated distribution shifts (Koh et al., 2021)
- Quantify data contamination in LLM evaluations (Srivastava et al., 2023)
2. **Validate Synthetic Data Utility**:
- Generate synthetic tasks with known solution structures (e.g., algorithmic reasoning; Anil et al., 2022)
- Test if models fail predictably on held-out complexity levels
- Compare synthetic vs. natural data for diagnosing model failures
3. **Deploy Dynamic Benchmarking**:
- Implement adversarial filtering for a text classification task (e.g., sentiment analysis)
- Track how "hardness" evolves over model generations
- Measure expert human performance as an upper bound
4. **Assess Multi-Dimensional Metrics**:
- Train identical architectures on standard vs. our benchmarks
- Compare rankings when optimizing for accuracy vs. robustness
- Conduct cost-benefit analysis of efficiency-accuracy tradeoffs
5. **Real-World Deployment**:
- Partner with MLPerf to integrate robustness tracks
- Release a community-driven benchmark for long-tail vision (inspired by iNaturalist; Van Horn et al., 2018)
- Organize a shared task with pre-registered evaluation protocols

Towards Robust and Scalable Benchmarks: Addressing Dataset Bias and Evaluation Gaps in Machine Learning
2. Problem Statement:
Current machine learning benchmarks suffer from critical limitations that undermine their reliability and generalizability. First, many widely used datasets (e.g., ImageNet, GLUE) exhibit inherent biases, such as label noise, demographic skews, or narrow task scope, leading to inflated performance metrics that do not translate to real-world scenarios (Torralba & Efros, 2011; Bender et al., 2021). Second, evaluation protocols often lack rigor, with fixed train-test splits encouraging overfitting and static leaderboards fostering "benchmark hacking" (Recht et al., 2019; Bowman & Dahl, 2021). Third, there is a growing disconnect between academic benchmarks and industrial applications, where models must handle dynamic, adversarial, or long-tail distributions (Koh et al., 2021; Ethayarajh & Jurafsky, 2022). These issues collectively hinder progress by misdirecting research efforts and obscuring true model capabilities.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that current benchmarks fail to capture the complexity and diversity of real-world data distributions, leading to overestimated model performance and poor out-of-distribution generalization. Prior work has shown that even small perturbations to test sets can drastically reduce model accuracy (Gardner et al., 2020), while adversarial examples reveal brittleness not reflected in standard evaluations (Hendrycks et al., 2021).
Our central hypothesis is that a benchmark's robustness can be significantly improved by:
(1) Incorporating multi-dimensional evaluation metrics that measure not only accuracy but also fairness, robustness, and efficiency (Parker-Holder et al., 2022).
(2) Introducing dynamic, procedurally generated test sets to prevent overfitting (Ribeiro et al., 2020).
(3) Explicitly modeling and controlling for dataset biases through causal frameworks (Veitch et al., 2021).
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a three-pronged approach to develop next-generation benchmarks:
(1) Bias-Aware Dataset Construction:
We will design datasets with explicit control over confounding variables (e.g., background, lighting, or demographic factors) using synthetic data generation tools like NVIDIA Omniverse (Jahanian et al., 2022) and causal graph-based sampling (Veitch et al., 2021). For natural language tasks, we will employ counterfactual augmentation techniques (Gardner et al., 2020) to create balanced subsets that isolate specific linguistic phenomena.
(2) Dynamic Evaluation Protocol:
Moving beyond static test sets, we will implement a "living benchmark" framework where models are evaluated on:
• Continuously updated test splits (e.g., monthly refreshes from crawling the web).
• Adversarially crafted examples via red-teaming (Perez et al., 2022).
• Stress tests with distribution shifts (e.g., corrupted images, domain transfers).
(3) Multi-Dimensional Metrics:
We will develop a unified scoring system that combines:
• Traditional accuracy/F1 scores.
• Robustness measures (e.g., performance drop under perturbations).
• Fairness metrics (e.g., subgroup performance disparities).
• Efficiency (FLOPs, memory footprint).
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. Quantify Existing Benchmark Limitations:
• Conduct large-scale audits of popular datasets (ImageNet, GLUE, The Pile) to measure label noise, demographic skews, and task coverage gaps (Bender et al., 2021; Birhane et al., 2021).
• Train standard models (ResNet, BERT, GPT-3) on these datasets and evaluate their performance drop under controlled perturbations (Hendrycks et al., 2021).
2. Develop Synthetic Benchmark Prototypes:
• Create synthetic vision datasets with explicit control over confounding variables using Blender and Omniverse (Jahanian et al., 2022).
• For NLP, build counterfactual-augmented versions of existing benchmarks (e.g., generating gender-swapped or negation-augmented text samples).
3. Validate Dynamic Evaluation:
• Implement a prototype "living benchmark" for image classification, where test images are sampled monthly from Flickr Commons.
• Compare model performance on static vs. dynamic splits to measure overfitting (Recht et al., 2019).
4. Test Multi-Dimensional Metrics:
• Train models optimized for different combinations of our proposed metrics (accuracy + robustness vs. accuracy + fairness).
• Conduct human evaluations to validate whether higher-scoring models are indeed more trustworthy in practice (Parker-Holder et al., 2022).
5. Deploy and Scale:
• Release open-source tools for generating bias-controlled datasets and dynamic evaluations.
• Partner with MLPerf and Hugging Face to integrate our metrics into industry-standard benchmarks.

**Towards Robust and Scalable Benchmarks: Addressing Dataset Biases and Evaluation Gaps in Machine Learning**
2. Problem Statement:
Current machine learning benchmarks often suffer from hidden biases, dataset contamination, and evaluation protocols that fail to capture real-world generalization. For instance, widely used datasets like ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009) and GLUE (Wang et al., 2018) have been shown to contain annotation artifacts (Gururangan et al., 2018) and distributional skews that inflate model performance. Additionally, benchmark tasks frequently lack diversity in modalities (e.g., text, vision, multimodal) and fail to stress-test models under distribution shifts (Koh et al., 2021). This creates a misleading perception of progress, as models may overfit to benchmark-specific quirks rather than solving underlying tasks.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that current benchmarks are insufficient for measuring true model capabilities due to three key limitations: (1) **static datasets** that do not evolve with model advancements, (2) **evaluation metrics** that prioritize narrow task performance over robustness, and (3) **lack of systematic stress-testing** for out-of-distribution generalization. Our central idea is that a benchmark framework incorporating dynamic dataset updates, adversarial evaluation protocols, and cross-modal task design can better reflect real-world performance. For example, recent work by Kiela et al. (2021) demonstrates that adversarial data collection improves benchmark robustness, while Taori et al. (2020) highlights the importance of distribution shift evaluation.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a three-part framework to address these challenges:
(1) **Dynamic Benchmark Construction**: We will design a benchmark with periodic updates to prevent overfitting, inspired by the Dynabench platform (Kiela et al., 2021). This involves crowd-sourcing adversarial examples and incorporating model-in-the-loop data collection to iteratively harden the benchmark.
(2) **Multidimensional Evaluation Metrics**: Beyond accuracy, we will integrate metrics for robustness (e.g., performance under synthetic corruptions (Hendrycks & Dietterich, 2019)), fairness (e.g., subgroup disparities (Sagawa et al., 2020)), and efficiency (e.g., inference latency vs. performance trade-offs).
(3) **Cross-Modal Task Design**: We will introduce tasks requiring joint reasoning across text, vision, and structured data, building on datasets like UniBench (Zhu et al., 2022) but with stricter controls for contamination and bias.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Audit Existing Benchmarks**:
• Quantify annotation artifacts in popular datasets (e.g., GLUE, SQuAD) using methods from Gururangan et al. (2018).
• Measure performance drop under synthetic distribution shifts (e.g., ImageNet-C (Hendrycks & Dietterich, 2019)).
2. **Develop Dynamic Data Collection**:
• Implement a model-in-the-loop pipeline to generate adversarial examples, similar to Dynabench.
• Validate that collected data reduces overfitting by testing on held-out models.
3. **Design Robustness Metrics**:
• Extend corruption benchmarks to multimodal tasks (e.g., text + image).
• Propose a composite "Robustness Score" aggregating performance across shifts and modalities.
4. **Evaluate Cross-Modal Generalization**:
• Train models on our new tasks and compare to state-of-the-art baselines (e.g., UniBench).
• Test zero-shot transfer to unseen domains to measure true generalization.
5. **Benchmark Scalability Analysis**:
• Profile computational costs of evaluation protocols (e.g., adversarial testing).
• Publish a leaderboard with efficiency-robustness trade-off curves.

Advancing AI Evaluation: A Framework for Dynamic, Multi-Dimensional Benchmarking
2. Problem Statement:
Current AI benchmarks suffer from several critical limitations: (1) Static datasets lead to overfitting and fail to capture real-world dynamics (Zhou et al., 2023); (2) Narrow evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy) ignore trade-offs between robustness, fairness, and efficiency (Rajpurkar et al., 2022); (3) Benchmark saturation occurs rapidly as models exploit dataset-specific biases (Recht et al., 2019). The lack of adaptive, multi-objective benchmarks hinders progress toward generalizable AI systems.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that benchmark quality is the primary bottleneck in measuring true AI progress. Prior work shows that 60% of published improvements vanish under more rigorous evaluation (Liang et al., 2022). Our key insight is that benchmarks must evolve alongside models through three mechanisms: (1) continuous data distribution shifts to prevent overfitting, (2) Pareto-optimal metric design to balance competing objectives, and (3) adversarial test-case generation to expose blind spots. We posit that such dynamic benchmarking will reveal 30-50% more performance variance between models compared to static evaluations (based on preliminary analysis of ImageNet variants).
4. Proposed Method:
(1) Dynamic Dataset Engine:
We will develop a configurable data pipeline that generates controlled distribution shifts via:
- Time-varying sampling from longitudinal datasets (e.g., WILDS 2.0; Koh et al., 2023)
- Procedural generation of edge cases using diffusion models (inspired by SynBench; Zhang et al., 2024)
- Human-in-the-loop data augmentation via Mechanical Turk
(2) Multi-Objective Metric Framework:
Building on ParetoFront (Deng et al., 2023), we will design:
- A weighted combination of 7 core metrics (accuracy, robustness, fairness, etc.)
- An adaptive weighting algorithm that adjusts metric importance based on deployment context
- Causal analysis tools to disentangle metric interactions
(3) Adversarial Benchmarking Protocol:
We will implement:
- Automated red teaming using gradient-based attacks (Carlini et al., 2023)
- Model-vs-model evaluation tournaments (similar to Arena; Bowman et al., 2024)
- Continuous leaderboard updates with hidden test cases
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. Validate Dynamic Data Effectiveness:
• Compare model performance on static vs. dynamic splits of 5 datasets (ImageNet, GLUE, etc.)
• Measure generalization gap reduction using out-of-distribution detection metrics
2. Test Multi-Objective Trade-offs:
• Train 10 model variants with different optimization priorities
• Plot 7-dimensional Pareto frontiers to identify dominant strategies
3. Stress-Test with Adversarial Cases:
• Generate 10,000 adversarial examples per benchmark using 4 attack strategies
• Quantify the correlation between robustness scores and real-world failure rates
4. Longitudinal Deployment Study:
• Run 6-month evaluation of 3 SOTA models on our evolving benchmark
• Track performance drift and catastrophic forgetting rates
5. Community Benchmarking Trial:
• Recruit 20 research labs to evaluate their models on our framework
• Conduct statistical analysis of variance compared to traditional benchmarks

Current machine learning benchmarks often suffer from dataset bias, lack of diversity, and evaluation protocols that fail to capture real-world generalization. For instance, widely used datasets like ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009) and GLUE (Wang et al., 2018) have been criticized for containing annotation artifacts (Gururangan et al., 2018) and limited task diversity (Srivastava et al., 2022). Additionally, benchmarks frequently overemphasize static performance metrics (e.g., accuracy) while neglecting dynamic aspects like robustness to distribution shifts (Taori et al., 2020) or computational efficiency (Dodge et al., 2019). This creates a misalignment between research progress and practical deployment needs.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the current benchmark ecosystem lacks systematic mechanisms to detect and mitigate dataset biases, measure out-of-distribution robustness, and evaluate efficiency trade-offs. For example, recent work by Bender et al. (2021) highlights how language models exploit superficial patterns in training data, leading to inflated performance metrics. Similarly, Koh et al. (2021) demonstrate that models often fail on subtle distribution shifts despite high in-distribution accuracy.
Our central idea is that a new benchmark framework—incorporating (1) dynamic data augmentation, (2) rigorous bias detection, and (3) multi-dimensional evaluation—can better reflect real-world model performance. We predict that such a framework will reveal significant gaps in existing models and drive progress toward more robust and efficient systems.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a three-part methodology to address these challenges:
(1) **Dynamic Dataset Construction**:
We will design datasets with controlled synthetic biases (e.g., spurious correlations) and systematic distribution shifts, inspired by the WILDS benchmark (Koh et al., 2021). This will involve generating adversarial splits (e.g., counterfactually augmented data as in Kaushik et al., 2020) and incorporating real-world noisy data sources (e.g., web-crawled text or uncurated images).
(2) **Bias Detection and Mitigation**:
We will develop automated tools to quantify dataset biases using techniques like influence functions (Koh & Liang, 2017) and embedding-space clustering (Swayamdipta et al., 2020). These tools will be integrated into a public dashboard for benchmark creators to audit their datasets.
(3) **Multi-Dimensional Evaluation Protocol**:
Moving beyond single-score metrics, we will introduce a composite evaluation framework measuring:
- **Robustness**: Performance under distribution shifts (e.g., ImageNet-C (Hendrycks & Dietterich, 2019))
- **Efficiency**: FLOPs, memory usage, and latency (similar to the EAI benchmark (Dodge et al., 2019))
- **Fairness**: Disparities across subgroups (e.g., using the Disparate Impact Ratio as in Buolamwini & Gebru, 2018)
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Synthetic Bias Experiments**:
- Construct datasets with known spurious correlations (e.g., background color predicting object class).
- Train models and measure their reliance on biases using gradient-based attribution methods (Sundararajan et al., 2017).
2. **Real-World Distribution Shift Evaluation**:
- Curate a benchmark with natural distribution shifts (e.g., geographic or temporal splits) following WILDS.
- Evaluate state-of-the-art models (e.g., CLIP, GPT-3) to quantify performance drops.
3. **Bias Detection Tool Validation**:
- Apply our tools to existing benchmarks (e.g., CIFAR-10, SQuAD) and compare with human-identified biases.
- Collaborate with dataset creators to implement fixes (e.g., rebalancing or reannotation).
4. **Efficiency-Robustness Trade-Off Analysis**:
- Profile models across our multi-dimensional metrics (e.g., robust accuracy vs. inference latency).
- Identify Pareto-optimal architectures using multi-objective optimization (Sener & Koltun, 2018).
5. **Community Adoption and Iteration**:
- Release our framework as an open-source toolkit with tutorials for benchmark creators.

Additionally, benchmarks frequently prioritize narrow metrics (e.g., accuracy) over broader robustness, fairness, and efficiency considerations. This creates a misalignment between research progress and practical deployment needs.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that existing benchmarks inadequately stress-test models due to: (1) **homogeneous data distributions**, which fail to represent real-world variability; (2) **evaluation shortcuts**, where models exploit superficial patterns rather than learning robust features; and (3) **static tasks**, which do not adapt to evolving real-world challenges.
Our central idea is that a new generation of benchmarks should incorporate:
- **Controlled synthetic data** to isolate specific failure modes (Geirhos et al., 2020).
- **Dynamic evaluation protocols** that test for distributional shift and adversarial robustness (Taori et al., 2020).
- **Multi-dimensional metrics** that balance accuracy, fairness, and computational cost (Ethayarajh & Jurafsky, 2021).
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a three-part framework for designing next-generation benchmarks:
(1) **Synthetic Data Augmentation**:
- Generate synthetic datasets with controlled variations (e.g., texture, lighting, or linguistic style) to isolate model biases. Inspired by work on synthetic benchmarks like CLEVR (Johnson et al., 2017), we will design tasks where spurious correlations are explicitly labeled and removable.
(2) **Dynamic Evaluation Protocols**:
- Introduce time-varying test splits that simulate real-world distribution shifts (e.g., gradual concept drift or sudden covariate shifts). This builds on the WILDS benchmark (Koh et al., 2021) but extends it to include adversarial perturbations and task reweighting.
(3) **Multi-Objective Metric Design**:
- Develop a unified scoring system that combines accuracy, robustness (measured via adversarial attacks), fairness (disparity across subgroups), and efficiency (FLOPs/latency). This will draw from recent work on Pareto-optimal evaluation (Dodge et al., 2021).
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Identify Bias Hotspots in Existing Benchmarks**:
- Conduct a meta-analysis of top datasets (e.g., ImageNet, COCO, SQuAD) using techniques like dataset cartography (Swayamdipta et al., 2020) to map regions of high model disagreement or bias.
- Replicate key findings from Recht et al. (2019) on ImageNet variants to quantify generalization gaps.
2. **Design and Validate Synthetic Tasks**:
- Create synthetic vision/text tasks where spurious features (e.g., background color or word frequency) are decoupled from labels.
- Benchmark state-of-the-art models (e.g., CLIP, GPT-3) to measure their reliance on shortcuts.
3. **Test Dynamic Evaluation Protocols**:
- Simulate distribution shifts by gradually modifying test sets (e.g., adding noise, domain shifts, or label skew).
- Compare model performance under static vs. dynamic evaluation, using WILDS as a baseline.
4. **Develop Multi-Objective Metrics**:
- Propose a weighted scoring function that balances accuracy, robustness (via AutoAttack), fairness (via subgroup error rates), and efficiency.
- Validate the metric’s predictive power by correlating it with real-world deployment outcomes (e.g., model recalls or user satisfaction).
5. **Release and Community Adoption**:
- Open-source benchmark tools and host a leaderboard to encourage adoption.
- Collaborate with MLPerf (Reddi et al., 2020) to integrate our metrics into industry-standard evaluations.

For instance, widely used datasets like ImageNet and GLUE have been shown to contain annotation errors, spurious correlations, and distributional mismatches that inflate model performance artificially (Bender et al., 2021; Recht et al., 2019). Additionally, benchmark tasks frequently lack diversity in task formulations, leading to overfitting to narrow evaluation metrics (Raji et al., 2021). There is a critical need for benchmarks that are (1) rigorously audited for biases, (2) designed to test generalization under distribution shifts, and (3) scalable to evolving model capabilities.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that current benchmarking practices overestimate model robustness due to three key gaps: (1) **static evaluation**, where benchmarks remain fixed while models evolve, (2) **task homogeneity**, where narrow task definitions fail to capture real-world complexity, and (3) **data leakage**, where test sets are inadvertently included in pretraining data (Magar & Schwartz, 2022). Our central idea is that a dynamic, multi-dimensional benchmarking framework—combining adversarial testing, synthetic data augmentation, and continuous evaluation—can better measure true model capabilities. We posit that such a framework will reveal performance gaps obscured by current benchmarks and drive progress toward more robust models.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a three-part methodology to address these challenges:
(1) **Bias Auditing and Dataset Refinement**:
- Leverage techniques from dataset cartography (Swayamdipta et al., 2020) to identify ambiguous or mislabeled examples in existing benchmarks.
- Introduce synthetic perturbations (e.g., texture shifts in vision, lexical substitutions in NLP) to test invariance to spurious features.
(2) **Dynamic Benchmark Construction**:
- Develop a benchmark generator that automatically creates task variants by perturbing input distributions, task formulations, and evaluation metrics.
- Incorporate "hidden test sets" (Kiela et al., 2021) to detect data contamination and overfitting.
(3) **Scalable Evaluation Protocols**:
- Design a meta-benchmark that dynamically adapts task difficulty based on model performance, ensuring continuous challenge (Zellers et al., 2021).
- Integrate human-in-the-loop evaluation for subjective tasks (e.g., dialogue quality) to complement automated metrics.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Audit Existing Benchmarks**:
- Apply dataset cartography to ImageNet, GLUE, and BIG-bench to quantify label noise and spurious correlations.
- Measure performance drop when models are evaluated on re-annotated or perturbed subsets.
2. **Test Generalization Under Distribution Shifts**:
- Train models on original benchmarks and evaluate on out-of-distribution (OOD) splits (e.g., ImageNet-V2, WILDS).
- Compare performance gaps between static and dynamically generated benchmarks.
3. **Evaluate Contamination Resilience**:
- Simulate data leakage by injecting benchmark examples into pretraining data and measure its impact on evaluation fairness.
- Test detection methods (e.g., n-gram overlap, embedding similarity) to flag contaminated examples.
4. **Benchmark Scalability Analysis**:
- Scale task complexity incrementally (e.g., longer sequences, multi-modal inputs) and track model performance.
- Compare compute-efficient models (e.g., distilled models) against large-scale foundations to identify evaluation bottlenecks.
5. **Human-AI Collaborative Evaluation**:
- Recruit domain experts to annotate model outputs for subjective tasks (e.g., creativity in text generation).
- Quantify discrepancies between automated metrics (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE) and human judgments.

1. Title:
Towards Robust and Scalable Benchmarks: Addressing Dataset Biases and Evaluation Gaps in Machine Learning
2. Problem Statement:
Current machine learning benchmarks often suffer from hidden biases, dataset contamination, and evaluation protocols that fail to capture real-world generalization. For instance, widely used datasets like ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009) and GLUE (Wang et al., 2018) have been shown to contain annotation artifacts (Gururangan et al., 2018) and data leakage (Swayamdipta et al., 2020), leading to inflated performance metrics. Additionally, benchmarks frequently lack diversity in task complexity and domain coverage, resulting in models that overfit to narrow distributions (Recht et al., 2019). There is a pressing need for benchmarks that systematically address these limitations while maintaining scalability and reproducibility.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that current benchmarking practices underestimate model robustness due to three key gaps: (1) insufficient stress-testing under distribution shifts, (2) lack of controlled synthetic tasks to isolate specific capabilities, and (3) overreliance on aggregate metrics that mask failure modes. Recent work on dynamic adversarial data collection (DynaBench; Kiela et al., 2021) and procedural generation (ProcTHOR; Deitke et al., 2022) demonstrates promising directions. We propose that a hybrid benchmark combining curated real-world data, synthetically generated edge cases, and adaptive evaluation protocols can better measure true model capabilities.
4. Proposed Method:
(1) **Bias-Aware Dataset Construction**:
We will develop a framework for auditing existing datasets using techniques like influence functions (Koh & Liang, 2017) and counterfactual augmentation (Gardner et al., 2020). For new datasets, we will implement stratified sampling to ensure balanced representation across demographic and semantic axes (e.g., geographic diversity in visual data).
(2) **Synthetic Task Generation**:
Inspired by work on diagnostic benchmarks (Sakaguchi et al., 2021), we will design a suite of procedurally generated tasks with tunable complexity. These will include:
- **Controlled Distribution Shifts**: Using domain randomization (Tobin et al., 2017) to simulate real-world variations.
- **Causal Reasoning Tests**: Building on CLEVR (Johnson et al., 2017) but with programmable ambiguity levels.
(3) **Adaptive Evaluation Protocol**:
We will extend dynamic benchmarking ideas from Dynabench to support:
- **Human-in-the-Loop Adversarial Refinement**: Allowing annotators to iteratively challenge model predictions.
- **Fine-Grained Failure Analysis**: Decomposing metrics by subpopulation and failure type (Panda et al., 2022).
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Audit Existing Benchmarks**:
- Apply dataset cartography (Swayamdipta et al., 2020) to identify "easy" and "ambiguous" examples in popular NLP/vision benchmarks.
- Quantify leakage risks using held-out contamination checks (Elangovan et al., 2021).
2. **Develop Synthetic Tasks**:
- Implement a parameterized task generator for compositional reasoning (extending CLUTRR; Sinha et al., 2019).
- Validate that difficulty scales predictably with parameters (e.g., graph depth, linguistic complexity).
3. **Test Under Distribution Shifts**:
- Evaluate SOTA models on our new benchmarks vs. traditional ones using:
- **Controlled Shifts**: e.g., synthetic weather variants of driving scenes.
- **Natural Shifts**: e.g., cross-dataset transfer between VQA-v2 (Goyal et al., 2017) and GQA (Hudson & Manning, 2019).
4. **Deploy Adaptive Evaluation**:
- Pilot human-in-the-loop adversarial collection with 100+ annotators (scaling Dynabench protocols).
- Measure the "adaptivity gap" between static and dynamic evaluation for 10+ models.
5. **Quantify Benchmark Robustness**:
- Compute sensitivity of model rankings to:
- **Data Subsampling**: Bootstrap resampling to estimate variance.
- **Metric Choices**: Compare aggregate vs. worst-case metrics (Koh et al., 2021).

**Advancing Dataset and Benchmark Design for Robust Machine Learning Evaluation**
2. Problem Statement:
Current machine learning benchmarks often suffer from critical limitations that hinder their ability to reliably measure model performance and generalization. Key issues include:
- **Dataset Bias and Artifacts**: Many widely used datasets (e.g., ImageNet, GLUE) contain unintended biases or annotation artifacts that models exploit, leading to inflated performance metrics that do not reflect true understanding (Gururangan et al., 2018; Torralba & Efros, 2011).
- **Static Evaluation**: Benchmarks are often static, allowing models to overfit to test sets over time (Recht et al., 2019). This undermines their utility for tracking progress.
- **Narrow Scope**: Most benchmarks focus on isolated tasks (e.g., classification) without capturing real-world complexities like multi-modal reasoning or long-tail distributions (Zellers et al., 2021).
- **Lack of Explainability Metrics**: Few benchmarks include rigorous measures of model interpretability or robustness to distribution shifts (Koh et al., 2021).
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that a new generation of benchmarks, designed with explicit safeguards against dataset biases, dynamic evaluation protocols, and multi-faceted task design, can provide a more accurate and comprehensive assessment of model capabilities. Our central thesis is that:
- **Dynamic Benchmarking**: Regularly updated test sets and adversarial evaluation (e.g., Dynabench; Kiela et al., 2021) can mitigate overfitting and better reflect real-world deployment conditions.
- **Bias-Aware Design**: Explicitly measuring and controlling for dataset biases (e.g., via counterfactual examples; Gardner et al., 2020) will yield more reliable performance estimates.
- **Multi-Dimensional Evaluation**: Benchmarks that combine traditional metrics with explainability, robustness, and efficiency measures (e.g., HELM; Liang et al., 2022) will better capture trade-offs in model development.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a three-part framework for designing next-generation datasets and benchmarks:
(1) **Bias Mitigation and Counterfactual Augmentation**:
- Leverage techniques like dataset cartography (Swayamdipta et al., 2020) to identify and rebalance biased subsets.
- Generate counterfactual examples (e.g., perturbing spurious correlations in text or images) to test model sensitivity to artifacts.
(2) **Dynamic Benchmark Infrastructure**:
- Develop a platform for continuous evaluation, where test sets are periodically refreshed or adversarially generated (e.g., via human-in-the-loop attacks).
- Implement a "living benchmark" protocol, inspired by Dynabench, where models are evaluated against evolving challenges.
(3) **Holistic Evaluation Metrics**:
- Integrate robustness checks (e.g., stress testing under distribution shifts; Taori et al., 2020) and explainability measures (e.g., faithfulness scores; DeYoung et al., 2020) into benchmark scoring.
- Introduce efficiency-aware metrics (e.g., FLOPs vs. accuracy trade-offs) to align with practical deployment needs.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Audit Existing Benchmarks**:
- Quantify biases in popular datasets (e.g., C4, WMT) using methods like dataset cartography.
- Measure overfitting trends by retesting historical models on held-out "hidden" test splits (Recht et al., 2019).
2. **Develop Counterfactual Test Suites**:
- For NLP: Generate contrast sets (Gardner et al., 2020) to probe sensitivity to minor semantic changes.
- For vision: Create synthetic variants of ImageNet with controlled spurious correlations (e.g., background shifts).
3. **Build Dynamic Evaluation Prototypes**:
- Deploy a pilot benchmark with quarterly test-set updates, tracking model performance decay over time.
- Integrate adversarial human-in-the-loop evaluation for subjective tasks (e.g., dialogue).
4. **Validate Holistic Metrics**:
- Train models with varying architectures (e.g., Transformers vs. SSMs) and compare rankings under traditional vs. robustness-aware metrics.
- Correlate explainability scores with real-world deployment outcomes (e.g., user trust).
5. **Scale and Disseminate**:
- Release open-source tools for bias detection and counterfactual generation.
- Partner with ML competitions (e.g., Kaggle, EvalAI) to adopt dynamic evaluation protocols.

**Advancing Dataset and Benchmark Design for Robust Machine Learning Evaluation**
2. Problem Statement:
Current machine learning benchmarks often suffer from critical limitations that hinder their ability to reliably measure model performance and generalization. Key issues include: (1) **Dataset bias and leakage**, where test sets inadvertently contain information from training data (e.g., due to improper splits or data duplication), leading to inflated performance metrics (Recht et al., 2019); (2) **Narrow evaluation scope**, where benchmarks focus on a single task or modality, failing to capture real-world complexity (Dodge et al., 2021); and (3) **Static benchmarks**, which become outdated as models improve, resulting in saturation and diminished discriminative power (Zellers et al., 2021). These limitations create a gap between reported performance and true model capabilities, undermining progress in the field.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that **dynamic, multi-faceted benchmarks with rigorous data curation and adversarial testing protocols** can provide a more accurate and comprehensive assessment of model capabilities. Prior work has shown that models often fail on out-of-distribution or adversarial examples despite high benchmark scores (Taori et al., 2020), suggesting that current evaluation practices are insufficient. Our central idea is that benchmarks should:
- **Incorporate temporal evolution**: Continuously update test sets to prevent saturation (e.g., Dynabench; Kiela et al., 2021).
- **Measure robustness**: Include adversarial, counterfactual, and distribution-shifted data to assess generalization (Koh et al., 2021).
- **Enable multi-dimensional evaluation**: Combine tasks across modalities (text, vision, audio) and cognitive skills (reasoning, memorization, abstraction).
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a three-part framework for next-generation benchmark design:
(1) **Data Quality and Leakage Mitigation**:
- Develop automated tools to detect and remove near-duplicates and contaminated data splits using techniques like MinHash (Broder, 1997) and embedding-based clustering.
- Implement **"time-travel" splits** for temporal data (e.g., news or social media), where models are trained on past data and tested on future data to prevent leakage (Lazaridou et al., 2021).
(2) **Dynamic Benchmark Construction**:
- Design a **"living benchmark"** platform where test sets are periodically refreshed via crowdworkers or generative models (e.g., using GPT-4 to create novel adversarial examples).
- Introduce **"hard subsets"** curated via model disagreement (Kadavath et al., 2022), where examples are selected based on high variance in predictions across strong models.
(3) **Multi-Dimensional Evaluation**:
- Integrate **cross-modal tasks** (e.g., text-to-image retrieval with counterfactual queries) to measure compositional understanding.
- Include **efficiency metrics** (e.g., inference speed, memory usage) alongside accuracy to assess practical utility.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Quantify Benchmark Saturation**:
- Analyze performance trends on existing benchmarks (e.g., GLUE, ImageNet) to measure saturation effects.
- Use statistical tests (e.g., linear regression on leaderboard scores over time) to identify declining discriminative power.
2. **Validate Data Leakage Detection**:
- Apply our MinHash/embedding tools to popular datasets (e.g., C4, The Pile) and measure the impact of deduplication on benchmark scores.
- Compare performance gaps between standard and "cleaned" splits for models like GPT-3 and T5.
3. **Test Temporal Generalization**:
- Construct time-based splits for Wikipedia and news corpora (e.g., train on pre-2020, test on post-2021).
- Evaluate whether models exhibit inflated performance on standard random splits versus time-based splits.
4. **Evaluate Dynamic Benchmarking**:
- Deploy a prototype "living benchmark" for NLP tasks, refreshing 10% of test data monthly via adversarial generation.
- Track leaderboard volatility and correlation with out-of-distribution performance.
5. **Assess Multi-Dimensional Metrics**:
- Train unified models (e.g., Flamingo; Alayrac et al., 2022) on our benchmark and compare rankings against single-task leaderboards.
- Conduct human evaluations to verify that efficiency metrics align with real-world usability.

Advancing Dataset and Benchmark Design for Robust and Scalable AI Evaluation
2. Problem Statement:
Current AI benchmarks and datasets suffer from critical limitations that hinder their ability to reliably measure model performance and generalization. Key issues include: (1) **Data leakage**, where test sets inadvertently overlap with training data, inflating metrics (Raffel et al., 2020); (2) **Narrow task scope**, with overemphasis on English-language or vision tasks, neglecting multimodal or low-resource settings (Rudinger et al., 2018); (3) **Static evaluation**, where benchmarks fail to adapt to emerging model capabilities, leading to saturation (Zellers et al., 2019); and (4) **Scalability gaps**, where benchmarks lack the computational infrastructure to evaluate large-scale models efficiently (Gao et al., 2021). These limitations undermine the reliability of AI progress claims and impede fair model comparison.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that a systematic redesign of dataset and benchmark construction can address these limitations by prioritizing **dynamic evaluation**, **task diversity**, and **scalable infrastructure**. Our central idea is that benchmarks should:
- **Dynamically evolve** via adversarial or crowd-sourced updates to prevent saturation (Kiela et al., 2021).
- **Integrate cross-modal and multilingual tasks** to better reflect real-world complexity (Srinivasan et al., 2021).
- **Leverage distributed compute** for efficient large-scale evaluation (Srivastava et al., 2022).
We predict that such benchmarks will yield more robust measurements of model capabilities and better highlight failure modes.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a three-part framework for next-generation benchmark design:
(1) **Dynamic Benchmark Construction**:
- Implement a "living benchmark" protocol where test sets are periodically refreshed via adversarial examples (e.g., using human-in-the-loop tools like Dynabench (Kiela et al., 2021)) or synthetic data generation (e.g., using diffusion models for vision tasks (Rombach et al., 2022)).
- Introduce a "hardness score" for each task, dynamically adjusted based on model performance to maintain challenge.
(2) **Multimodal and Multilingual Integration**:
- Curate tasks that require cross-modal reasoning (e.g., text-to-image retrieval with counterfactual queries (Yuksekgonul et al., 2023)).
- Expand low-resource language coverage using collaboration with native speakers (e.g., Masakhane for African languages (Nekoto et al., 2020)).
(3) **Scalable Evaluation Infrastructure**:
- Develop a distributed evaluation toolkit (inspired by HELM (Liang et al., 2022)) to parallelize inference across thousands of tasks.
- Optimize for GPU memory efficiency using techniques like gradient checkpointing and mixed-precision inference (Chen et al., 2021).
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Benchmark Saturation Analysis**:

**Advancing AI Evaluation: A Framework for Dynamic, Multimodal, and Bias-Aware Benchmarking**
2. Problem Statement:
Current AI benchmarks suffer from three critical limitations: (1) **static datasets** fail to capture real-world dynamics, leading to overfitting and poor generalization (Recht et al., 2019); (2) **narrow modality focus** (e.g., text-only or image-only tasks) ignores the multimodal nature of human intelligence (Liang et al., 2022); and (3) **bias evaluation is ad hoc**, with no systematic way to measure or mitigate dataset biases (Bender et al., 2021). These gaps hinder progress toward robust, generalizable AI systems.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that a next-generation benchmarking framework must address these limitations simultaneously. Specifically:
- **Dynamic datasets** that evolve over time (e.g., via crowd-sourced updates or synthetic data generation) will better reflect real-world distribution shifts.
- **Multimodal task design** (e.g., joint text-video-audio reasoning) will expose gaps in current models’ cross-modal integration capabilities.
- **Bias quantification** through causal graphs (Feder et al., 2022) can systematically identify and mitigate spurious correlations.
Our central thesis is that integrating these three pillars will yield benchmarks that are more predictive of real-world performance.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a three-part framework:

**Advancing AI Evaluation: A Framework for Dynamic, Multi-Dimensional Benchmarking and Dataset Curation**
2. Problem Statement:
Current AI benchmarks and datasets suffer from critical limitations that hinder their ability to accurately measure progress in machine learning. Static benchmarks (e.g., GLUE, SuperGLUE) quickly saturate as models improve, while task-specific datasets (e.g., ImageNet, SQuAD) lack the complexity to evaluate generalizable reasoning. Recent work highlights three key gaps: (1) **Task Diversity**: Benchmarks often focus on narrow tasks, failing to capture cross-domain capabilities (Raffel et al., 2020). (2) **Dynamic Adaptation**: Fixed datasets cannot evolve with model advancements, leading to "benchmark overfitting" (Kiela et al., 2021). (3) **Bias and Fairness**: Many datasets inherit societal biases, skewing evaluation outcomes (Bender et al., 2021). Without addressing these issues, benchmarks risk misdirecting research efforts and overestimating real-world applicability.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that a **dynamic, multi-dimensional benchmarking framework**—one that integrates **adaptive difficulty**, **cross-task transfer**, and **bias-aware metrics**—can provide a more rigorous and scalable evaluation paradigm. Prior work shows that dynamically generated tasks (Zhou et al., 2023) and meta-benchmarks (Srivastava et al., 2022) improve robustness, but no unified solution exists. Our central thesis is that benchmarks must:
- **Evolve** via human-AI collaboration to prevent saturation (e.g., Dynabench; Kiela et al., 2021).
- **Integrate multi-modal tasks** to assess compositional reasoning (e.g., M3Exam; Zhang et al., 2023).
- **Embed fairness audits** at the dataset level (e.g., Datasheets for Datasets; Gebru et al., 2021).
We posit that such a framework will better correlate with real-world performance and reduce overfitting risks.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a three-part framework for next-generation benchmarking:
**(1) Dynamic Task Generation**:
- Leverage adversarial data collection (Dynabench-style) where humans and models co-create challenging examples.
- Implement procedural generation for synthetic tasks (e.g., BabyAI; Chevalier-Boisvert et al., 2019) to scale diversity.
**(2) Multi-Dimensional Evaluation**:
- Design a **hierarchical benchmark** with "core" tasks (language, vision, reasoning) and "compositional" tasks requiring cross-domain integration.
- Introduce **difficulty scaling** via controllable parameters (e.g., programmatically varying task complexity in CLEVR; Johnson et al., 2017).
**(3) Bias-Aware Dataset Curation**:
- Integrate tools like REVISE (Wang et al., 2022) to audit datasets for spurious correlations and representation gaps.
- Develop a **fairness scorecard** quantifying skews across demographic, linguistic, and geographic axes.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Benchmark Existing Datasets**:
- Audit 10 major benchmarks (e.g., BIG-bench, HELM) for saturation, bias, and task coverage using metrics from Ethayarajh & Jurafsky (2021).
- Identify gaps via failure mode analysis (e.g., where SOTA models still struggle).
2. **Prototype Dynamic Task Generation**:
- Build a Dynabench-style platform for text and image tasks, recruiting human annotators to challenge GPT-4 and Claude 3.
- Measure the "adversarial gap" between static and dynamic evaluation (Kiela et al., 2021).
3. **Validate Multi-Dimensional Design**:
- Train models on our hierarchical benchmark and compare to single-task baselines. Key metric: **transfer efficiency** (performance on unseen tasks).
- Test difficulty scaling by evaluating the same model on CLEVR variants with increasing object counts.
4. **Quantify Bias Mitigation**:
- Apply REVISE to our datasets and compute fairness scorecards. Compare to un-audited benchmarks using disparity metrics (Blodgett et al., 2021).
5. **Longitudinal Study**:
- Deploy our framework for 6 months, tracking benchmark saturation rates versus static benchmarks.

**Towards Robust and Scalable Benchmarks: Addressing Dataset Biases and Evaluation Gaps in Machine Learning**
2. Problem Statement:
Current machine learning benchmarks often suffer from hidden biases, dataset contamination, and evaluation protocols that fail to generalize to real-world scenarios. For instance, widely used datasets like ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009) and GLUE (Wang et al., 2018) have been criticized for label noise, distributional shifts, and task-specific overfitting (Recht et al., 2019; McCoy et al., 2019). Additionally, benchmarks frequently lack diversity in data modalities (e.g., multimodal or long-tail distributions) and fail to measure robustness under adversarial or out-of-distribution conditions (Hendrycks & Dietterich, 2019). This limits their utility in driving progress toward generalizable AI systems.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that existing benchmarks are overly optimized for narrow performance metrics (e.g., top-1 accuracy) while neglecting critical dimensions such as fairness, scalability, and real-world applicability. For example, recent work by Bender et al. (2021) highlights how dataset contamination in pretraining corpora inflates model performance artificially. Our central idea is that a systematic redesign of benchmark creation and evaluation protocols—focusing on **controlled diversity**, **dynamic updates**, and **stress-testing**—can mitigate these issues. We propose that:
- **Controlled diversity**: Curating datasets with explicit stratification across demographic, linguistic, or domain-specific axes (e.g., Buolamwini & Gebru, 2018) will reduce hidden biases.
- **Dynamic updates**: Regularly refreshed test sets (like Dynabench; Kiela et al., 2021) can prevent overfitting to static evaluations.
- **Stress-testing**: Incorporating adversarial perturbations (e.g., ImageNet-C; Hendrycks & Dietterich, 2019) and out-of-distribution splits will better measure robustness.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a three-part framework for benchmark innovation:
(1) **Bias-Aware Dataset Curation**:
- Leverage techniques from fairness-aware ML (Mehrabi et al., 2021) to audit existing datasets for representation gaps.
- Introduce synthetic data augmentation (e.g., SynthText; Gupta et al., 2016) to fill underrepresented categories while controlling for confounding variables.
(2) **Dynamic Evaluation Protocols**:
- Design a "living benchmark" platform where test sets evolve via human-in-the-loop adversarial examples (Kiela et al., 2021).
- Implement model-in-the-loop data collection to iteratively identify edge cases (e.g., Natural Instructions; Mishra et al., 2022).
(3) **Multidimensional Metrics**:
- Move beyond aggregate scores by reporting disaggregated performance across subgroups (Buolamwini & Gebru, 2018).
- Integrate efficiency metrics (e.g., FLOPs vs. accuracy trade-offs) and robustness scores (e.g., corruption error rates; Hendrycks & Dietterich, 2019).
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Audit Existing Benchmarks**:
- Quantify biases in popular datasets (e.g., COCO, WMT) using fairness metrics (Mehrabi et al., 2021).
- Re-annotate subsets to measure label noise impact (Recht et al., 2019).
2. **Build Controlled Diversity Datasets**:
- Collaborate with domain experts to stratify data by gender, dialect, and socioeconomic factors (Buolamwini & Gebru, 2018).
- Release "clean" and "biased" splits to study model sensitivity.
3. **Test Dynamic Evaluation**:
- Deploy Dynabench-style crowdsourcing to collect adversarial examples for NLP tasks (Kiela et al., 2021).
- Measure performance drop over multiple benchmark iterations.
4. **Stress-Test Robustness**:
- Evaluate models on ImageNet-C (Hendrycks & Dietterich, 2019) and WILDS (Koh et al., 2021) out-of-distribution splits.
- Report subgroup performance disparities (e.g., racial bias in face recognition; Buolamwini & Gebru, 2018).
5. **Benchmark Scalability**:
- Profile computational costs (memory, latency) across dataset sizes (e.g., scaling from 10K to 10M samples).
- Compare metrics like throughput vs. accuracy for models trained on our benchmarks vs. traditional ones.

Widely used datasets like ImageNet, GLUE, and WMT exhibit known biases (Torralba & Efros, 2011; Ruder et al., 2019), while evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, BLEU) may not align with human judgment or downstream task performance (Novikova et al., 2017). Additionally, benchmark tasks are often static, making them vulnerable to overfitting and gaming (Zellers et al., 2019). There is a critical need for benchmarks that are (1) dynamically updated to prevent saturation, (2) representative of diverse real-world conditions, and (3) evaluated with metrics that reflect practical utility.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that current benchmark performance is inflated due to dataset-specific biases and narrow evaluation criteria. For example, models trained on ImageNet achieve high accuracy but struggle with distribution shifts (Recht et al., 2019), and NLP models optimized for BLEU scores often produce unnatural outputs (Callison-Burch et al., 2006). We propose that benchmarks must incorporate three key properties to address these limitations:
- **Dynamic Adversarial Construction**: Continuously updated tasks to prevent overfitting (Kiela et al., 2021).
- **Multi-Dimensional Evaluation**: Metrics that assess robustness, fairness, and human alignment (Ethayarajh & Jurafsky, 2021).
- **Controlled Diversity**: Datasets with explicit stratification across demographic, linguistic, and domain-specific factors (Buolamwini & Gebru, 2018).
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a framework for creating and evaluating benchmarks with the following components:
(1) **Dynamic Benchmark Construction**:
- Implement a crowdsourced adversarial data collection pipeline inspired by Dynabench (Kiela et al., 2021), where human annotators generate challenging examples to "break" current models.
- Use reinforcement learning to prioritize data points that maximize model uncertainty, similar to the approach in AdvGLUE (Wang et al., 2021).
(2) **Multi-Dimensional Evaluation Protocol**:
- Develop a suite of metrics beyond accuracy, including robustness to perturbations (e.g., ImageNet-C (Hendrycks & Dietterich, 2019)), fairness across subgroups (e.g., Disaggregated Evaluation (Sagawa et al., 2020)), and human-rated quality (e.g., HUSE (Hashimoto et al., 2019)).
- Integrate these metrics into a unified scoring system, weighting them based on task-specific requirements.
(3) **Controlled Dataset Diversity**:
- Collaborate with domain experts to stratify datasets along axes such as geographic origin (e.g., DollarStreet (Shankar et al., 2017)), linguistic variety (e.g., XTREME (Hu et al., 2020)), and temporal shifts (e.g., WILDS (Koh et al., 2021)).
- Use synthetic data augmentation techniques (e.g., SynthText (Gupta et al., 2016)) to fill underrepresented regions of the data distribution.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Identify Benchmark Gaps**:
- Conduct a meta-analysis of 10+ popular benchmarks (e.g., ImageNet, GLUE, SQuAD) to quantify bias and saturation effects using methods from Recht et al. (2019) and Zellers et al. (2019).
- Survey practitioners to identify unmet evaluation needs (e.g., robustness to rare subpopulations).
2. **Build Dynamic Data Collection Pipeline**:
- Deploy a Dynabench-style platform for image and text tasks, recruiting annotators via Mechanical Turk and professional platforms (e.g., Scale AI).
- Train adversarial models to generate hard examples, iteratively updating the dataset every 3 months.
3. **Validate Multi-Dimensional Metrics**:
- Compare proposed metrics (robustness, fairness, human alignment) against traditional metrics on 5 diverse tasks (e.g., image classification, machine translation).
- Correlate metric scores with real-world deployment outcomes using datasets like WILDS (Koh et al., 2021).
4. **Evaluate Controlled Diversity**:
- Stratify existing datasets (e.g., COCO) along geographic and demographic axes, measuring performance gaps using disaggregated evaluation (Sagawa et al., 2020).
- Test whether synthetic augmentation improves coverage of rare subgroups using techniques from SynthText (Gupta et al., 2016).
5. **Benchmark Scalability and Adoption**:
- Release 3 pilot benchmarks (image, text, multimodal) with dynamic updates and multi-dimensional metrics.
- Track adoption and model performance over 12 months, comparing against static benchmarks to assess impact.
