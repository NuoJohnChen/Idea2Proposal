1. Title:
Generative Models with Dynamic Latent Manifolds: Bridging the Gap Between Realism and Controllability
2. Problem Statement:
Current generative models, such as GANs (Goodfellow et al., 2014) and diffusion models (Ho et al., 2020), excel at producing high-fidelity samples but struggle with fine-grained controllability and interpretability. While latent-space editing (Shen et al., 2020) and prompt-based methods (Ramesh et al., 2022) offer partial solutions, they often lack robustness or require extensive manual tuning. Additionally, existing approaches typically operate on static latent spaces, limiting their ability to adapt to diverse generation tasks dynamically. There is a critical need for generative models that balance sample quality with intuitive, dynamic control mechanisms.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the rigidity of static latent spaces in generative models is a key bottleneck for controllability. Prior work (Kingma & Welling, 2014; Higgins et al., 2017) has shown that disentangled latent representations improve interpretability, but these are often fixed after training. We propose that a *dynamic latent manifold*—where the structure of the latent space adapts to input conditions or user guidance—can bridge the realism-controllability gap. Our central idea is that by learning a *task-aware latent geometry*, the model can interpolate and edit samples more effectively while maintaining high fidelity.
4. Proposed Method:
(1) **Dynamic Latent Manifold Learning**: We will extend variational autoencoders (VAEs) and diffusion models by replacing static latent spaces with a learnable manifold that evolves based on input conditions. The manifold will be parameterized as a Riemannian space (Arvanitidis et al., 2018) with adaptive curvature, allowing the model to "bend" the latent space for specific tasks (e.g., style transfer or attribute editing).
(2) **Controllable Generation via Geodesic Steering**: To enable precise control, we will develop a geodesic-based sampling strategy. Instead of linear interpolations, we will compute shortest paths (geodesics) on the dynamic manifold, ensuring smooth and semantically meaningful transitions between samples. This builds on work in optimal transport (Chen et al., 2020) but adapts it to conditional generation.
(3) **Hybrid Architecture for Scalability**: To scale to high-resolution data, we will integrate our approach with a hierarchical diffusion model (Nichol & Dhariwal, 2021). The dynamic manifold will operate at multiple scales, with coarse-level edits propagating to finer levels via a cross-attention mechanism (Vaswani et al., 2017).
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Validate Dynamic Manifold Learning**:
• Train a VAE with a dynamic latent space on synthetic datasets (e.g., dSprites) and measure disentanglement scores (Higgins et al., 2017).
• Compare interpolation quality (Frechet Inception Distance) against static baselines.
2. **Test Geodesic Steering**:
• Benchmark geodesic paths against linear interpolations on CelebA-HQ for attribute editing (e.g., smile, age).
• Quantify controllability via user studies (precision of edits vs. realism).
3. **Scale to Diffusion Models**:
• Integrate the dynamic manifold into a pretrained diffusion model (e.g., Stable Diffusion) and evaluate text-to-image alignment (CLIP score) and edit fidelity.
4. **Evaluate Generalization**:
• Test zero-shot adaptation to unseen tasks (e.g., sketch-to-image) by retraining only the manifold parameters.
5. **Benchmark Against SOTA**:
• Compare sample quality (FID, IS) and controllability (LPIPS diversity) against GANs (StyleGAN-XL) and diffusion models (Imagen).

**Generative Models with Dynamic Latent Manifolds: Bridging the Gap Between Sample Quality and Interpretability**
2. Problem Statement:
Current generative models, such as GANs (Goodfellow et al., 2014) and diffusion models (Ho et al., 2020), excel at producing high-fidelity samples but often lack interpretable latent representations. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) (Kingma & Welling, 2014) offer structured latent spaces but struggle with sample quality compared to GANs or diffusion models. This creates a fundamental tension: models with high sample quality tend to have opaque or entangled latent spaces, while models with interpretable latents sacrifice sample fidelity. Additionally, existing methods often assume static latent manifolds, limiting their ability to adapt to complex, multi-modal data distributions. There is a critical need for generative models that simultaneously achieve high sample quality and interpretable, dynamically adaptable latent representations.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the trade-off between sample quality and interpretability stems from rigid latent space assumptions. For instance, VAEs enforce a fixed prior (e.g., Gaussian), while GANs lack explicit latent structure. Recent work (Chen et al., 2016; Higgins et al., 2017) shows that disentangled representations improve interpretability but often degrade sample quality. We propose that dynamically learning the latent manifold structure—where the manifold adapts to the data distribution—can bridge this gap. Specifically, we hypothesize that a generative model with a *dynamic latent manifold* (DLM), where the latent space topology evolves during training, can achieve both high sample quality and interpretability by better capturing multi-modal and hierarchical data features.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a novel framework, **Dynamic Latent Manifold Generative Models (DLM-GM)**, with three key components:
(1) **Latent Manifold Learning via Optimal Transport**:
We will use optimal transport (OT) (Arjovsky et al., 2017) to learn a data-dependent latent manifold. Instead of a fixed prior, the latent space will be optimized to minimize the Wasserstein distance between the learned and target distributions. This adapts the manifold structure to the data, enabling better alignment between latent codes and data features.
(2) **Dynamic Topology Adaptation**:
We will introduce a *manifold update mechanism* that iteratively refines the latent space topology during training. Inspired by Riemannian geometry (Bécigneul & Ganea, 2019), we will parameterize the manifold curvature and update it via gradient-based optimization. This allows the model to dynamically adjust to multi-modal or hierarchical data.
(3) **Hybrid Training Objective**:
To balance sample quality and interpretability, we will combine adversarial training (for fidelity) with a VAE-like reconstruction loss (for structure). The adversarial loss will use a non-saturating GAN objective (Miyato et al., 2018), while the reconstruction loss will employ a perceptual metric (Zhang et al., 2018) to preserve high-level features.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Validate Dynamic Manifold Learning on Synthetic Data**:
- Generate synthetic datasets with known multi-modal or hierarchical structure (e.g., nested Gaussians, Swiss rolls).
- Train DLM-GM and baselines (VAE, GAN, diffusion models) and compare:
• Sample quality (FID, Inception Score).
• Latent interpretability (disentanglement metrics like DCI, MIG).
• Manifold adaptability (visualize latent trajectories).
2. **Test on Controlled Real-World Data**:
- Use datasets with clear latent factors (e.g., dSprites, 3D Shapes).
- Measure how well DLM-GM captures ground-truth factors vs. static-latent models.
- Ablate the manifold update mechanism to isolate its contribution.
3. **Scale to High-Dimensional Data**:
- Train on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-64, comparing to state-of-the-art generative models.
- Evaluate sample quality (FID, Precision/Recall) and latent utility (e.g., linear probe accuracy).
4. **Assess Downstream Task Performance**:
- Use DLM-GM for conditional generation and latent-based tasks (e.g., classification, retrieval).
- Compare to baselines on:
• Few-shot learning (latent transfer).
• Latent interpolation smoothness (human evaluation).
5. **Quantify Computational Efficiency**:
- Benchmark training time and memory usage vs. GANs/VAEs/diffusion models.
- Profile the manifold update overhead and optimize for scalability.

1. Title:
**Generative Models with Dynamic Latent Structures: Bridging the Gap Between Autoregressive and Diffusion Approaches**
2. Problem Statement:
Current generative models are broadly divided into autoregressive (AR) models, which excel at high-fidelity generation but suffer from slow sequential sampling, and diffusion models, which enable parallel sampling but often struggle with fine-grained detail preservation. While hybrid approaches like latent diffusion models (LDMs) have shown promise, they still face trade-offs in computational efficiency, sample quality, and training stability. A key limitation is the static nature of their latent representations, which cannot adaptively allocate modeling capacity to complex or simple regions of the data distribution. This rigidity leads to inefficiencies in both training and inference, particularly for heterogeneous datasets where some samples require more modeling effort than others.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that introducing dynamic latent structures—where the complexity of the latent representation adapts to the input—can simultaneously improve the efficiency and quality of generative models. Prior work in hierarchical VAEs (e.g., Vahdat & Kautz, 2020) and adaptive diffusion steps (e.g., Watson et al., 2021) has shown the benefits of multi-scale modeling, but these approaches still rely on fixed architectures. We propose that a *data-dependent* latent structure, where the depth and width of the model vary per sample, could better capture the intrinsic dimensionality of the data. Specifically, we hypothesize that:
- Dynamic depth (varying the number of latent layers per sample) will improve sample quality by focusing computation on complex regions.
- Dynamic width (varying the latent dimension per layer) will reduce redundancy in simple regions, speeding up inference.
- A unified training objective can learn these adaptations without sacrificing stability or requiring hand-tuned heuristics.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a framework called **Dynamic Latent Generative Models (DLGM)**, which integrates three key innovations:
(1) **Adaptive Latent Hierarchy**: Instead of a fixed hierarchy, we will design a stochastic gating mechanism that dynamically activates or skips latent layers based on the input. This will be implemented via a lightweight router network that predicts layer importance scores, inspired by mixture-of-experts architectures (Fedus et al., 2022). The router will be trained end-to-end with a sparsity-inducing penalty to avoid overuse of resources.
(2) **Variable-Rate Diffusion**: For the diffusion backbone, we will extend the denoising process to support adaptive step sizes and noise schedules conditioned on the input’s complexity. This builds on recent work in learned diffusion schedules (Chen et al., 2023) but adds per-sample adaptation. The key challenge is maintaining stable training; we will address this with a novel gradient clipping strategy that bounds the variance of updates.
(3) **Efficient Sampling via Latent Pruning**: To accelerate inference, we will develop a pruning mechanism that collapses or bypasses low-importance latent dimensions during sampling. This will leverage the router’s importance scores to sparsify the latent space dynamically, reducing FLOPs without sacrificing quality.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Validate Dynamic Depth on Synthetic Data**:
- Train DLGM on toy datasets (e.g., 2D spirals, MNIST) where the complexity varies spatially.
- Measure whether the router allocates more layers to high-curvature regions.
- Compare sample quality and training speed against fixed-depth baselines (e.g., DDPM, PixelCNN).
2. **Benchmark on Image Generation Tasks**:
- Evaluate DLGM on FFHQ, ImageNet, and LSUN Bedroom at resolutions up to 256x256.
- Key metrics: FID, Inception Score (IS), and sampling speed (steps/sec).
- Ablate the impact of dynamic width by freezing the router and measuring quality drop.
3. **Test Generalization to Video and 3D Data**:
- Extend DLGM to video generation (UCF-101) and 3D shape synthesis (ShapeNet).
- Assess whether the dynamic structure captures temporal or geometric complexity.
4. **Quantify Efficiency Gains**:
- Profile FLOPs and memory usage during training and inference.
- Compare against state-of-the-art hybrids (e.g., LDM, MaskGIT) on a fixed compute budget.
5. **Analyze Failure Modes and Robustness**:
- Stress-test the router’s decisions on out-of-distribution inputs.
- Investigate cases where dynamic pruning degrades quality (e.g., fine textures).

1. Title:
**Generative Models with Adaptive Latent Dynamics: Bridging the Gap Between Sample Quality and Computational Efficiency**
2. Problem Statement:
Current generative models, such as diffusion models (Ho et al., 2020) and autoregressive transformers (Brown et al., 2020), achieve impressive sample quality but suffer from significant computational inefficiencies. Diffusion models require hundreds or thousands of iterative steps for generation, while autoregressive models scale quadratically with sequence length due to self-attention. Efficient alternatives like GANs (Goodfellow et al., 2014) often struggle with mode collapse and unstable training dynamics. There is a critical need for generative models that balance high-fidelity synthesis with scalable inference, particularly for long-context or high-dimensional data (e.g., video, 3D scenes).
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the inefficiencies of existing generative models stem from rigid latent dynamics—e.g., fixed Markov chains in diffusion models or static attention patterns in transformers. These constraints limit their ability to adapt computation to the complexity of the data. For instance, simple regions of an image (e.g., uniform backgrounds) do not require the same iterative refinement as fine details (e.g., textures).
Our central idea is to introduce **adaptive latent dynamics**, where the generative process dynamically adjusts its computational pathway based on input complexity. We posit that this can be achieved by:
1) **Input-dependent transition kernels** in diffusion models, allowing variable-step refinement.
2) **Sparse, content-aware attention** in autoregressive models to reduce quadratic overhead.
3) **Hierarchical latent spaces** that allocate computation to high-variance regions of the data distribution.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a unified framework for adaptive generative modeling, addressing the above challenges in three parts:
(1) **Dynamic Diffusion Kernels**:
We will replace the fixed noise schedule in diffusion models with input-conditional transitions. Inspired by Ruiz et al. (2023), we will parameterize the noise schedule as a lightweight neural network that predicts step sizes based on local data complexity. This will allow the model to "skip" redundant steps in homogeneous regions.
(2) **Sparse Latent Attention**:
For autoregressive generation, we will design a hybrid architecture combining state-space models (Gu et al., 2022) and block-sparse attention (Beltagy et al., 2020). The model will learn to dynamically route attention to critical tokens, reducing the effective context length without sacrificing coherence.
(3) **Hierarchical Latent Allocation**:
Drawing from VQ-VAE (van den Oord et al., 2017), we will introduce a coarse-to-fine latent hierarchy where higher-resolution layers are selectively activated for complex regions. This will be guided by a gating mechanism trained adversarially to match the data distribution.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Validate Adaptive Diffusion**:
• Train a dynamic diffusion model on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, measuring FID vs. step count.
• Compare to baselines (DDPM, DDIM) with fixed schedules. Key metric: Steps saved for comparable quality.
• Test generalization to out-of-distribution data (e.g., sketches → photos).
2. **Benchmark Sparse Autoregression**:
• Evaluate language modeling on PG-19 (Rae et al., 2020) with varying context lengths (1K–8K tokens).
• Measure perplexity vs. FLOPs, targeting 50% reduction in compute for equivalent performance to dense transformers.
• Probe attention patterns to confirm dynamic sparsity aligns with semantic units (e.g., noun phrases).
3. **Test Hierarchical Generation**:
• Train on video prediction (BAIR Robot Pushing) and 3D shape synthesis (ShapeNet).
• Quantify reconstruction error (PSNR, LPIPS) for ablated hierarchies.
• Visualize latent activation maps to verify computation is focused on high-detail regions.
4. **Scale to Multimodal Data**:
• Jointly train on text-image pairs (LAION-5B) using adaptive latent sharing.
• Evaluate zero-shot cross-modal retrieval (R@1) and generation diversity (Intra-FID).
5. **Ablations and Efficiency Analysis**:
• Ablate components (dynamic kernels, sparse attention, hierarchy) to isolate contributions.
• Profile memory usage and throughput vs. baseline models (e.g., Stable Diffusion, GPT-3).
• Measure wall-clock time for generation at comparable quality thresholds.

1. Title:
Generative Diffusion Models with Dynamic Latent Structure for High-Fidelity Long-Form Synthesis
2. Problem Statement:
Current diffusion models excel at generating high-quality samples in domains like images and short audio, but they struggle with long-form content generation (e.g., hour-long music, feature-length videos, or multi-page documents). The fundamental limitations are: (1) quadratic memory overhead in standard attention-based architectures (Ho et al., 2020), (2) loss of coherence over long time horizons due to Markovian assumptions (Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2015), and (3) inability to dynamically adjust computation to match local complexity (e.g., allocating more capacity to critical segments like musical transitions). While recent work has explored hierarchical diffusion (Vahdat et al., 2021) and latent distillation (Meng et al., 2022), these approaches either sacrifice fine-grained control or require costly multi-stage training.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the key limitation is the static nature of the diffusion process—each timestep applies uniform computation regardless of the underlying data complexity. In contrast, human creativity operates with dynamic focus (e.g., spending more effort on a painting’s focal point). Drawing inspiration from neuroscience (Hawkins et al., 2022), we posit that introducing dynamic latent structure—where the model allocates variable-depth processing to different spatial/temporal regions—could bridge this gap. Our core hypothesis is that a diffusion model with:
- **Input-Adaptive Computation**: Latent variables that control the depth of refinement at each spatiotemporal location.
- **Global-Local Coordination**: A hierarchical latent space where high-level structure guides local details.
will outperform fixed-architecture diffusion models in long-form generation while maintaining efficiency.
4. Proposed Method:
(1) **Dynamic Latent Diffusion**: We will replace the static UNet backbone with a gated architecture where each residual block’s activation is modulated by a learned "compute gate" conditioned on the input. This builds on the latent diffusion framework (Rombach et al., 2022) but extends it with dynamic routing akin to Mixture-of-Experts (Shazeer et al., 2017). The gates will be trained via a sparsity-inducing loss to ensure computational efficiency.
(2) **Structured Latent Scheduling**: We will develop a two-phase diffusion process:
- **Phase 1 (Global Structure)**: A low-dimensional latent space trained with adversarial objectives (Dhariwal & Nichol, 2021) to capture long-range dependencies.
- **Phase 2 (Local Refinement)**: A high-resolution diffusion conditioned on Phase 1’s output, using the dynamic gates to focus computation on regions requiring detail.
(3) **Efficient Long-Context Attention**: To handle the memory challenge, we will integrate Hyena operators (Poli et al., 2023) for sub-quadratic sequence mixing, replacing standard self-attention in the UNet.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Validate Dynamic Gating on Short Sequences**:
- Train ablated models on 64x64 images with synthetic "importance maps" (e.g., MNIST with labeled digit regions).
- Measure whether compute gates correlate with human-annotated critical regions.
2. **Test Hierarchical Coherence in Audio**:
- Generate 10-minute musical pieces conditioned on chord progressions.
- Evaluate with metrics from (Donahue et al., 2023): (a) consistency of key/meter, (b) note-level precision.
3. **Benchmark Against Video Diffusion Baselines**:
- Train on 128-frame videos from Kinetics-700 (Carreira et al., 2019).
- Compare to Imagen Video (Ho et al., 2022) using FVD (Unterthiner et al., 2018) and human A/B testing.
4. **Profile Efficiency Gains**:
- Measure FLOPs vs. quality trade-off using dynamic gating.
- Compare memory usage during training against standard latent diffusion.
5. **Ablation Studies**:
- Freeze gates to static patterns: Does performance drop?
- Vary the latent hierarchy depth: How does it affect long-range coherence?

Generative Models for High-Fidelity 3D Content Synthesis: Bridging the Gap Between Scalability and Realism
2. Problem Statement:
Despite significant advances in generative models (e.g., GANs, diffusion models, autoregressive transformers), synthesizing high-fidelity 3D content (e.g., meshes, textures, and dynamic scenes) remains a formidable challenge. Current methods struggle with scalability, often producing artifacts or unrealistic outputs when generating complex 3D structures (e.g., fine-grained geometry or photorealistic textures). For instance, diffusion models excel in 2D image synthesis but face computational bottlenecks when extended to 3D domains due to memory and sampling inefficiencies (Poole et al., 2022; Ho et al., 2020). Meanwhile, autoregressive models like Point-E (Nichol et al., 2022) lack the ability to capture long-range dependencies in 3D space, leading to incoherent geometries. A critical gap exists between the scalability of existing generative architectures and the realism demanded by applications like virtual reality, gaming, and industrial design.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the limitations of current 3D generative models stem from two key factors: (1) inadequate inductive biases for 3D data (e.g., equivariance to rotations, translations, and scaling), and (2) inefficient sampling strategies that fail to exploit the hierarchical nature of 3D structures. Recent work (Sajjadi et al., 2022; Chan et al., 2022) suggests that integrating geometric priors into diffusion models can improve 3D synthesis, but these approaches remain computationally expensive.
Our central hypothesis is that a hybrid architecture combining the strengths of diffusion models (for high-quality local detail) and graph neural networks (for global structure) can achieve scalable, high-fidelity 3D generation. By explicitly modeling geometric transformations and hierarchical dependencies, we believe such a model can outperform existing methods in both quality and efficiency.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a three-part framework for scalable 3D content synthesis:
(1) **Geometric-Aware Diffusion**: We will extend diffusion models to operate directly on 3D point clouds and meshes by incorporating SE(3)-equivariant layers (i.e., layers invariant to rigid-body transformations). This builds on the success of EDM (Equivariant Diffusion Model) (Hoogeboom et al., 2022) but adapts it for 3D data by introducing a novel noise schedule that accounts for voxel density and curvature.
(2) **Hierarchical Graph-Based Sampling**: To address scalability, we will develop a coarse-to-fine sampling strategy where a graph neural network (GNN) first generates a low-resolution 3D scaffold, which is then refined by the diffusion model. The GNN will use attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies, similar to MeshGraphNets (Pfaff et al., 2021), but with dynamic edge updates to adapt to varying densities.
(3) **Differentiable Rendering for Adversarial Feedback**: To enhance realism, we will integrate a differentiable renderer (e.g., Mitsuba 3) into the training loop, enabling adversarial feedback from a discriminator network. This mimics the approach of StyleGAN3 (Karras et al., 2021) but extends it to 3D by penalizing inconsistencies in lighting, shadows, and material properties.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Validate Geometric Equivariance**:
- Train baseline diffusion models (EDM, DDPM) on ShapeNet (Chang et al., 2015) and measure their failure modes under rigid transformations.
- Compare against our SE(3)-equivariant variant using metrics like Chamfer distance and normal consistency.
2. **Test Hierarchical Sampling**:
- Generate coarse 3D scaffolds using GNNs and refine them with diffusion.
- Evaluate scalability by measuring memory usage and inference time for increasing resolutions (e.g., 64³ to 512³ voxels).
3. **Benchmark Against State-of-the-Art**:
- Compare our model against Point-E, DreamFusion (Poole et al., 2022), and GET3D (Chan et al., 2022) on ShapeNet and Matterport3D.
- Use Fréchet Point Cloud Distance (FPD) and perceptual metrics (LPIPS) for quantitative evaluation.
4. **Assess Realism via Differentiable Rendering**:
- Train a discriminator on rendered views of real vs. synthetic 3D objects.
- Measure improvements in photorealistic metrics (e.g., PSNR, SSIM) after adversarial fine-tuning.
5. **Ablation Studies**:
- Isolate the contribution of each component (equivariance, hierarchical sampling, adversarial feedback).
- Vary the GNN’s attention span to study its impact on global coherence.

**Generative Models for High-Fidelity, Controllable Synthesis of Complex Data Distributions**
2. Problem Statement:
Current generative models, such as diffusion models (Ho et al., 2020) and autoregressive transformers (Brown et al., 2020), excel at synthesizing high-quality samples but face critical limitations: (1) They struggle with fine-grained controllability, often requiring extensive fine-tuning or auxiliary networks (e.g., classifier guidance) to steer outputs (Dhariwal & Nichol, 2021). (2) Their sampling efficiency remains poor—diffusion models require hundreds of steps, and autoregressive models scale quadratically with sequence length. (3) They lack interpretable latent spaces, making it difficult to disentangle factors of variation (Bengio et al., 2013). These issues hinder deployment in domains like drug discovery or content creation, where precision and efficiency are paramount.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that integrating *explicit hierarchical structure* and *dynamic computation* into generative frameworks can address these limitations. Prior work shows that hierarchical VAEs (Vahdat & Kautz, 2020) improve sample quality but sacrifice controllability, while flow-based models (Kingma & Dhariwal, 2018) offer invertibility but scale poorly. Our key insight is that *adaptive sparsity*—dynamically activating subsets of model parameters based on input—could enable efficient, controllable generation. For example, a model could focus computation on semantically relevant regions (e.g., molecule functional groups in drug design) while skipping irrelevant parts. We further posit that *disentangled latent bottlenecks* (Locatello et al., 2019) combined with diffusion processes can yield interpretable controls without sacrificing sample quality.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a three-part framework:
(1) **Hierarchical Diffusion with Latent Bottlenecks**:
- Design a multi-scale diffusion model where each level operates on a compressed latent space, trained with variational bounds (Rombach et al., 2022). The bottleneck layers will enforce disentanglement via contrastive learning (Chen et al., 2020).
(2) **Dynamic Sparsity via Gating Mechanisms**:
- Introduce input-dependent gating (Shazeer et al., 2017) to activate only relevant model pathways during generation. For example, in image synthesis, gates could route computation based on detected object categories.
(3) **Efficient Sampling with Learned Solvers**:
- Replace fixed diffusion schedules with a learned ODE solver (Karras et al., 2022) to reduce sampling steps. The solver will predict optimal step sizes conditioned on latent variables.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Validate Disentanglement in Latent Bottlenecks**:
- Train on synthetic datasets (e.g., dSprites) with known ground-truth factors (Locatello et al., 2019).
- Measure disentanglement metrics (DCI, MIG) and compare to vanilla diffusion models.
2. **Test Controllability on Domain-Specific Tasks**:
- Drug Design: Generate molecules with target properties using QSAR labels as controls (Gómez-Bombarelli et al., 2018).
- Text-to-Image: Steer outputs via CLIP embeddings (Ramesh et al., 2021), quantifying alignment with R-Precision.
3. **Benchmark Sampling Efficiency**:
- Compare steps/sec and FID scores against DDPM (Ho et al., 2020) and Consistency Models (Song et al., 2023) on ImageNet-64.
4. **Ablate Dynamic Sparsity**:
- Freeze gates to study the impact of adaptive computation on sample quality (measured by PSNR) and throughput.

**Generative Models for High-Fidelity and Controllable Synthesis: Bridging the Gap Between Quality and Interpretability**
2. Problem Statement:
Current generative models, such as diffusion models (Ho et al., 2020) and large language models (Brown et al., 2020), have achieved remarkable success in generating high-quality outputs. However, they face critical limitations: (1) **controllability**—fine-grained control over generated content (e.g., spatial or semantic attributes) remains challenging (Ramesh et al., 2022); (2) **efficiency**—training and inference costs scale prohibitively with model size (Kaplan et al., 2020); and (3) **interpretability**—the black-box nature of these models limits their adoption in high-stakes domains like healthcare or legal applications (Doshi-Velez & Kim, 2017). While recent work has explored disentangled representations (Higgins et al., 2017) or latent-space editing (Shen et al., 2020), no unified framework addresses these gaps without sacrificing generation quality.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the key to bridging this gap lies in **hierarchical latent representations** combined with **explicit control mechanisms**. Prior work has shown that hierarchical VAEs (Vahdat & Kautz, 2020) improve sample quality, while diffusion models with classifier guidance (Dhariwal & Nichol, 2021) enable coarse control. However, neither approach fully leverages structured latent spaces for fine-grained, interpretable control.
Our central idea is to design a hybrid architecture that:
- **Decomposes generation into semantically meaningful latent variables** (e.g., object-level attributes in images or topic-level features in text).
- **Integrates differentiable control mechanisms** (e.g., energy-based models or sparse attention) to enable dynamic steering of generation.
We predict this will achieve state-of-the-art fidelity while enabling intuitive user interaction, as demonstrated in preliminary work by (Liu et al., 2023) on controllable text generation.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a three-part framework:
**(1) Hierarchical Latent Diffusion**:
- Extend diffusion models to operate on a tree-structured latent space, where each level captures progressively finer-grained features (e.g., scene layout → object shapes → textures).
- Use cross-attention between levels to enforce consistency, inspired by (Saharia et al., 2022)’s work on cascaded diffusion.
**(2) Energy-Based Control**:
- Introduce an energy function parameterized by user-specified constraints (e.g., "generate a cat with blue eyes").
- Adapt the sampling process to minimize this energy via Langevin dynamics, similar to (Grathwohl et al., 2021), but with learned gradients for efficiency.
**(3) Sparse Latent Editing**:
- Develop a sparse intervention mechanism using gradient-based attribution (similar to (Bau et al., 2020)) to identify and modify only relevant latent dimensions.
- Validate this with human-in-the-loop experiments to ensure usability.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Validate Hierarchical Latent Space**:
- Train ablated models (flat vs. hierarchical latents) on synthetic datasets with known structure (e.g., CLEVR).
- Metrics: Reconstruction error, disentanglement scores (Kim & Mnih, 2018), and sample quality (FID).
2. **Test Controllability on Image Generation**:
- Benchmark against Stable Diffusion (Rombach et al., 2022) and GANs on fine-grained editing tasks (e.g., "add a hat to this person").
- Metrics: CLIP similarity (Radford et al., 2021), user preference studies.
3. **Scale to Text Generation**:
- Adapt the framework for autoregressive text generation using latent prompts (Li et al., 2022).

**Generative Models with Dynamic Latent Manifolds: Bridging the Gap Between Sample Quality and Diversity**
2. Problem Statement:
Current generative models, such as GANs, VAEs, and diffusion models, struggle to simultaneously achieve high sample quality and diversity, often exhibiting mode collapse or unrealistic outputs. While diffusion models excel in quality, they suffer from slow sampling speeds due to iterative denoising steps. Conversely, GANs generate samples quickly but are prone to instability during training and fail to cover the full data distribution. Recent hybrid approaches, like consistency models, attempt to address these trade-offs but still lack principled mechanisms to adaptively control the latent space geometry. There is a critical need for a framework that dynamically adjusts the latent manifold structure to balance fidelity and diversity while maintaining efficient sampling.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the rigidity of fixed latent manifolds in existing generative models limits their ability to capture complex, multi-modal data distributions. For instance, VAEs enforce a static Gaussian prior, while GANs implicitly learn a latent space that may not align with the data’s intrinsic geometry. Recent work by [1] shows that adaptive manifold learning can improve representation learning, but this has not been systematically applied to generative modeling.
Our central idea is to introduce *dynamic latent manifolds* (DLMs), where the geometry of the latent space evolves during both training and inference. We posit that by conditioning the manifold structure on input-dependent features, the model can dynamically allocate latent capacity to high-density regions of the data distribution. This could enable:
- **Better mode coverage**: Adaptive manifolds can expand or contract to capture underrepresented modes.
- **Faster sampling**: By focusing computation on relevant regions, iterative refinement can be reduced.
- **Stable training**: Explicit manifold regularization can mitigate GAN-style instability.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a three-part framework for generative models with DLMs:
(1) **Manifold Dynamics**: We will design a learnable latent space where the metric tensor is input-dependent. Inspired by [2], we will use a hypernetwork to predict local curvature parameters (e.g., Riemannian metrics) from latent codes. This allows the manifold to stretch or compress regions based on data density.
(2) **Efficient Sampling via Geodesic Flow**: To accelerate sampling, we will derive a geodesic-based ODE solver that leverages the dynamic manifold. Unlike diffusion models that use fixed noise schedules, our solver will adaptively adjust step sizes based on local curvature, similar to [3]. This should reduce the number of steps needed for high-quality samples.
(3) **Stabilized Training Objective**: We will introduce a novel loss combining:
- **Wasserstein-2 distance** with DLM-aware transport costs.
- **Topological regularization** to prevent manifold fragmentation (e.g., via persistent homology [4]).
- **Mode-seeking terms** to explicitly penalize mode collapse.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Validate Manifold Adaptivity**:
- Train DLMs on synthetic multi-modal datasets (e.g., 2D rings with varying densities).
- Quantify mode coverage using metrics like Jensen-Shannon divergence between true and generated distributions.
- Compare to static-manifold baselines (VAE, GAN).
2. **Benchmark Sampling Speed**:
- Measure wall-clock time for generating 10k samples on CIFAR-10/ImageNet.
- Compare against DDPM, Consistency Models, and FastGAN.
- Ablate the impact of geodesic step adaptation.
3. **Evaluate Downstream Quality**:
- Train class-conditional DLMs on ImageNet-1K.
- Assess FID, Inception Score, and precision/recall metrics.
- Test zero-shot transfer to out-of-distribution data (e.g., stylized variants).
4. **Analyze Latent Geometry**:
- Use UMAP/t-SNE to visualize dynamic manifold adjustments.
- Correlate local curvature with data density (e.g., kernel density estimates).
- Ablate hypernetwork architecture choices.
5. **Scale to High-Resolution Data**:
- Extend DLMs to 256x256 images via hierarchical latent spaces.
- Study trade-offs between manifold complexity and memory usage.
- Profile training stability on 8xV100 GPUs.

1. Title:
**Generative Models for Compositional Generalization: Bridging the Gap Between Training and Novel Combinations**
2. Problem Statement:
Current generative models, such as autoregressive Transformers and diffusion models, excel at generating high-fidelity samples but struggle with compositional generalization—the ability to systematically combine learned concepts into novel, unseen configurations. For example, language models often fail to generate coherent text when combining rare or disjoint concepts, and image generators produce artifacts when composing objects in unconventional arrangements (Lake & Baroni, 2018; Dziri et al., 2022). This limitation stems from their reliance on statistical correlations rather than explicit compositional reasoning, which restricts their applicability to tasks requiring creativity or systematicity (e.g., program synthesis, few-shot learning).
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the lack of explicit compositional structure in existing generative models is a key bottleneck. While architectures like Transformers capture local dependencies well, they lack mechanisms to enforce hierarchical or relational constraints during generation (Russin et al., 2020). Our central idea is that integrating neurosymbolic principles—such as symbolic program induction or graph-based reasoning—into the generative process can enable models to decompose and recombine concepts systematically. Specifically, we propose that a hybrid model combining neural likelihood estimation with symbolic memory buffers (Andreas et al., 2020) will outperform purely neural baselines on tasks requiring novel compositions.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a three-part framework:
(1) **Neurosymbolic Latent Space Design**:
We will augment a diffusion model’s latent space with symbolic primitives (e.g., scene graphs for images, syntax trees for text). These primitives will be learned jointly via a variational objective, where a neural encoder maps raw data to symbolic structures, and a decoder reconstructs the data conditioned on these structures (Shi et al., 2022). The symbolic layer will enforce constraints (e.g., spatial relationships in images) during generation.
(2) **Dynamic Composition via Memory Buffers**:
To handle novel combinations, we will introduce a memory buffer that stores and retrieves symbolic primitives during generation. This buffer will be updated via attention mechanisms, allowing the model to "swap" components dynamically (e.g., replacing an object in a scene graph while preserving layout). The buffer’s operations will be differentiable, enabling end-to-end training (Santoro et al., 2018).
(3) **Efficient Training with Curriculum Learning**:
We will train the model on progressively harder compositional tasks, starting with simple combinations (e.g., single-object edits) and scaling to complex scenes or sentences. The curriculum will be guided by a novelty metric that quantifies how far a generated sample deviates from training data (Zhang et al., 2021).
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Synthetic Compositional Tasks**:
- Test the model on synthetic benchmarks like SCAN (Lake & Baroni, 2018), where models must generalize to unseen command combinations.
- Measure accuracy on held-out compositions (e.g., "jump twice after running") versus neural baselines (e.g., GPT-3).
2. **Image Generation with Novel Compositions**:
- Train on datasets like CLEVR (Johnson et al., 2017) with held-out object arrangements.
- Evaluate using metrics like Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) and human judgments of compositional coherence.
3. **Language Model Evaluation**:
- Fine-tune on tasks requiring rare concept combinations (e.g., "write a poem about quantum biology").
- Compare perplexity and human-rated creativity against Transformer-XL (Dai et al., 2019).
4. **Ablation Studies**:
- Remove the symbolic memory buffer to isolate its contribution.
- Vary the granularity of symbolic primitives (e.g., words vs. phrases in text) to study trade-offs.
5. **Real-World Deployment**:
- Apply the model to a creative design task (e.g., generating product descriptions from attribute combinations).
- Measure user satisfaction and time saved versus manual creation.

**Generative Models with Dynamic Latent Structures: Bridging the Gap Between Sample Quality and Computational Efficiency**
2. Problem Statement:
Current generative models, such as diffusion models (Ho et al., 2020) and autoregressive transformers (Brown et al., 2020), achieve impressive sample quality but suffer from high computational costs during training and inference. Diffusion models require hundreds of iterative steps for high-fidelity generation, while autoregressive models scale quadratically with sequence length. Recent attempts to improve efficiency, such as latent diffusion models (Rombach et al., 2022) or sparse attention mechanisms (Child et al., 2019), either sacrifice sample quality or introduce architectural complexity. There is a critical need for generative models that maintain high sample fidelity while reducing computational overhead, particularly for long-sequence or high-resolution data.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the inefficiency of existing generative models stems from their static latent structures—fixed hierarchies or attention patterns that do not adapt to input complexity. For example, diffusion models apply uniform denoising steps regardless of local image complexity, while autoregressive models allocate equal attention to all tokens. We propose that dynamically adjusting the latent structure—such as varying the number of diffusion steps per pixel or sparsifying attention based on input content—could significantly improve efficiency without compromising quality.
Our central hypothesis is that a generative model with **input-dependent latent dynamics** can achieve Pareto-optimal trade-offs between sample quality and compute. Specifically, we predict that:
- Dynamic diffusion steps (fewer steps for "easy" regions, more for "hard" regions) will reduce inference time while preserving perceptual quality.
- Content-aware sparsification in autoregressive models will enable near-linear scaling for long sequences without losing coherence.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a framework for **Dynamic Latent Generative Models (DLGM)** with three key innovations:
(1) **Input-Adaptive Diffusion Scheduling**:
We will replace the fixed-step denoising process in diffusion models with a dynamic scheduler. A lightweight predictor network will estimate per-pixel or per-patch complexity (e.g., edge density, texture variation) and allocate denoising steps proportionally. This builds on latent diffusion (Rombach et al., 2022) but adds a learned stopping criterion akin to adaptive ODE solvers (Chen et al., 2018).
(2) **Content-Sparse Autoregressive Attention**:
For autoregressive models, we will design a gating mechanism that sparsifies attention heads based on token relevance scores. Inspired by Mixture of Experts (Shazeer et al., 2017), each head will activate only for tokens meeting a learned salience threshold, reducing redundant computations. We will integrate this with block-sparse attention patterns (Zaheer et al., 2020) for hardware efficiency.
(3) **Unified Training via Latent Balancing**:
To stabilize training of dynamic structures, we will introduce a gradient-balancing loss that ensures neither "easy" nor "hard" regions are neglected. This extends the idea of curriculum learning (Bengio et al., 2009) to latent space dynamics, with a regularizer penalizing excessive variance in per-element computational budgets.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Validate Dynamic Diffusion on Images**:
- Train a baseline diffusion model (DDPM) on FFHQ (Karras et al., 2019) and measure per-region step requirements via oracle experiments (e.g., masking "easy" regions during inference).
- Compare our adaptive scheduler against fixed-step baselines using metrics like FID (Heusel et al., 2017) and wall-clock time.
2. **Test Autoregressive Sparsification on Text**:
- Implement content-sparse attention in a GPT-style model (Brown et al., 2020) and evaluate on PG-19 (Rae et al., 2020) for long-document modeling.
- Measure perplexity vs. FLOPs/token and analyze attention patterns to verify sparsification aligns with linguistic boundaries (e.g., sentence breaks).
3. **Cross-Modal Generalization**:
- Apply DLGM to audio (LibriSpeech; Panayotov et al., 2015) and video (Kinetics; Kay et al., 2017) to test if dynamic structures generalize beyond images/text.
- Key test: Can the model reduce steps for silent audio frames or static video backgrounds?
4. **Ablation Studies**:
- Ablate components (e.g., disable gradient balancing) to isolate their contributions.
- Vary the granularity of dynamic decisions (e.g., per-pixel vs. per-patch in images) to find optimal trade-offs.
5. **Benchmark Against SOTA**:
- Compare to recent efficient generators (e.g., Consistency Models; Song et al., 2023) on standard tasks (e.g., ImageNet-1K generation).
- Profile memory usage and throughput on TPUv4 to quantify real-world gains.

**Generative Models with Dynamic Latent Structures: Bridging the Gap Between Expressivity and Efficiency**
2. Problem Statement:
Current generative models, such as diffusion models (Ho et al., 2020) and autoregressive transformers (Brown et al., 2020), achieve impressive results but face critical limitations. Diffusion models suffer from slow sampling due to iterative denoising steps, while autoregressive models are inherently sequential, limiting their scalability. Variational autoencoders (VAEs) (Kingma & Welling, 2014) and generative adversarial networks (GANs) (Goodfellow et al., 2014) struggle with mode collapse or unstable training dynamics. A fundamental challenge is the trade-off between expressivity (the ability to model complex distributions) and efficiency (fast sampling and training). Recent work, such as latent diffusion models (Rombach et al., 2022), attempts to address this but still relies on costly iterative refinement. There is a need for generative models that can achieve high-fidelity synthesis without sacrificing computational efficiency.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the key to bridging this gap lies in **dynamic latent structures**—latent representations that adapt their complexity based on the input’s inherent difficulty. Current generative models use fixed latent dimensions or iterative processes regardless of input complexity, leading to inefficiencies. For example, simple images may require fewer latent variables than highly detailed ones, but existing models allocate uniform computational resources.
Our central idea is to introduce **input-adaptive latent hierarchies**, where the model dynamically allocates latent variables and computational steps based on the input’s complexity. This approach draws inspiration from sparse attention mechanisms (Child et al., 2019) and adaptive computation (Graves, 2016). We hypothesize that such a model will:
- Achieve comparable or better sample quality than diffusion models while reducing sampling steps.
- Outperform autoregressive models in parallelizability and scalability.
- Mitigate mode collapse by dynamically adjusting latent space density.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a three-part framework for **Dynamic Latent Generative Models (DLGM)**:
(1) **Input-Adaptive Latent Allocation**:
We will design a gating mechanism that dynamically allocates latent variables based on input complexity. Inspired by mixture-of-experts (Shazeer et al., 2017), the model will route inputs to sparse subsets of latent dimensions. This will be implemented via a lightweight "coordinator" network that predicts latent sparsity patterns.
(2) **Hierarchical Refinement with Early Exit**:
Instead of fixed-depth networks, we will adopt a hierarchical latent structure where simpler inputs exit early, reducing computation. This builds on progressive growing (Karras et al., 2018) but with dynamic depth. We will use a reinforcement learning-based controller to train the exit policy (Teerapittayanon et al., 2016).
(3) **Efficient Training via Latent Sparsity Regularization**:
To ensure stable training, we will introduce a sparsity-inducing loss that encourages the model to use minimal latent dimensions. This draws from variational sparse coding (Dai et al., 2018) but adapts it for generative tasks. We will also explore gradient-based methods (Louizos et al., 2018) to optimize the trade-off between sparsity and quality.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Validate Dynamic Latent Allocation**:
- Synthetic tasks: Test whether DLGM can adapt latent usage for varying-complexity inputs (e.g., MNIST vs. FFHQ).
- Compare to fixed-latent baselines (VAE, VQ-VAE) on reconstruction error and sampling speed.
2. **Benchmark Against Diffusion Models**:
- Train DLGM on ImageNet-256 and compare FID scores and sampling time against DDPM (Ho et al., 2020) and Latent Diffusion (Rombach et al., 2022).
- Measure the distribution of latent usage across samples to verify adaptivity.
3. **Test Scalability on Long-Form Data**:
- Apply DLGM to audio generation (e.g., LibriSpeech) and compare to autoregressive transformers (Défossez et al., 2022).
- Evaluate parallel sampling speed and memory usage.
4. **Ablation Studies**:
- Disable dynamic components to isolate their contributions.
- Vary the sparsity penalty to study its impact on sample diversity.
5. **Downstream Applications**:
- Fine-tune DLGM for text-to-image generation and compare to Stable Diffusion.
- Explore few-shot adaptation by freezing the coordinator and fine-tuning only latent experts.

**Generative Models with Dynamic Latent Manifolds: Bridging the Gap Between Sample Quality and Diversity**
2. Problem Statement:
Current generative models, such as GANs (Goodfellow et al., 2014) and diffusion models (Ho et al., 2020), excel at producing high-fidelity samples but often struggle with mode collapse or limited diversity. While VAEs (Kingma & Welling, 2014) and flow-based models (Dinh et al., 2017) offer better theoretical guarantees, they lag behind in sample quality. The trade-off between sample quality and diversity remains unresolved, particularly in complex, high-dimensional domains like natural images or 3D shapes. Additionally, existing models lack explicit mechanisms to adapt their latent representations dynamically during generation, limiting their ability to capture multi-modal distributions effectively.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the rigidity of fixed latent spaces in current generative models is a key bottleneck. For instance, GANs and VAEs often assume a static prior distribution (e.g., Gaussian), which may not reflect the true data manifold. Recent work (Bond-Taylor et al., 2022) has shown that dynamic latent spaces can improve generative performance, but these approaches are still limited to specific domains.
Our central idea is to introduce **dynamic latent manifolds**—learnable, input-conditional structures that adapt during generation. We posit that by allowing the latent space to evolve based on intermediate generation steps, the model can better capture multi-modal distributions and mitigate mode collapse. This could bridge the quality-diversity gap while maintaining computational efficiency.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a novel framework called **Dynamic Manifold Generative Models (DMGM)**, which integrates three key innovations:
(1) **Latent Manifold Learning with Adaptive Priors**:
We will replace static priors (e.g., Gaussian) with learned, input-dependent manifolds. Inspired by Riemannian flow models (Gemici et al., 2016), we will parameterize the latent space as a dynamically warped manifold, where the curvature adjusts based on the generated samples. This will involve training a hypernetwork (Ha et al., 2017) to predict manifold parameters conditioned on partial generation steps.
(2) **Hierarchical Latent Dynamics**:
To handle multi-scale generation, we will design a hierarchical latent structure where higher-level manifolds guide lower-level sampling. This builds on hierarchical VAEs (Vahdat & Kautz, 2020) but extends them with dynamic transitions between layers. We will use graph neural networks (Kipf & Welling, 2017) to model dependencies between latent levels, enabling smoother interpolation and mode coverage.
(3) **Efficient Sampling via Differentiable Projections**:
To avoid costly iterative sampling (e.g., diffusion models), we will develop a differentiable projection operator that maps samples back to the dynamic manifold at each step. This operator will be trained end-to-end using a combination of adversarial and reconstruction losses, ensuring both quality and diversity.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Validate Dynamic Manifolds on Synthetic Data**:
- Generate synthetic datasets with known multi-modal distributions (e.g., mixtures of Gaussians, spirals).
- Compare DMGM against baselines (GANs, VAEs, diffusion models) on mode coverage and sample quality.
- Metrics: Inception Score (IS), Fréchet Distance (FID), and mode collapse ratio.
2. **Benchmark on Standard Image Datasets**:
- Train DMGM on CIFAR-10, ImageNet-32x32, and FFHQ (128x128).
- Evaluate sample quality (FID, Precision/Recall) and diversity (LPIPS, nearest-neighbor analysis).
- Ablate the impact of hierarchical dynamics vs. flat latent spaces.
3. **Test Generalization to 3D Shapes**:
- Apply DMGM to ShapeNet (Chang et al., 2015) for 3D point cloud generation.
- Measure Chamfer Distance and Earth Mover’s Distance (EMD) against ground truth.
- Investigate if dynamic manifolds improve symmetry and topological consistency.
4. **Efficiency and Scalability Analysis**:
- Benchmark sampling speed (steps/sec) against diffusion models and GANs.
- Profile memory usage during training with varying latent dimensions.
- Study scaling behavior by training models of increasing size (100M to 1B parameters).
5. **Downstream Task Evaluation**:
- Use DMGM for downstream tasks like image inpainting and super-resolution.
- Compare against state-of-the-art methods (e.g., Palette (Saharia et al., 2022)).
- Assess whether dynamic manifolds improve task-specific metrics (PSNR, SSIM).

1. Title:
Generative Models with Adaptive Latent Dynamics: Bridging the Gap Between Quality and Efficiency
2. Problem Statement:
Current generative models, particularly diffusion models and autoregressive transformers, exhibit a fundamental trade-off between sample quality and computational efficiency. Diffusion models achieve state-of-the-art results in image and audio generation but require hundreds to thousands of iterative steps during inference, making them prohibitively slow for real-time applications. Autoregressive models, while faster, suffer from error accumulation and sequential generation bottlenecks. Hybrid approaches like latent diffusion models (Rombach et al., 2022) mitigate some issues but still rely on iterative refinement. There is a pressing need for generative models that can produce high-fidelity samples in fewer steps without sacrificing expressivity.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the inefficiency of existing generative models stems from their fixed latent dynamics—whether in the form of predefined noise schedules (diffusion) or rigid autoregressive dependencies. Recent work (Kingma et al., 2021; Salimans & Ho, 2022) suggests that adaptive noise schedules can improve diffusion model efficiency, but these approaches remain heuristic. We propose that generative models can achieve both quality and efficiency by learning *input-dependent latent trajectories*. Specifically, we posit that a generative model conditioned on the input's intrinsic complexity (e.g., local texture in images or phoneme transitions in speech) can dynamically allocate computational resources, skipping unnecessary refinement steps for simpler regions while focusing on challenging details.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a three-part framework for adaptive latent dynamics in generative models:
(1) **Input-Dependent Trajectory Learning**:
We will replace fixed noise schedules or autoregressive dependencies with a learned latent trajectory controller. For diffusion models, this involves predicting the noise schedule and step sizes conditioned on intermediate latent states, inspired by the adaptive step-size mechanisms in differential equation solvers (Chen et al., 2018). For autoregressive models, we will introduce a gating mechanism to dynamically skip or emphasize certain tokens based on their contextual predictability.
(2) **Efficiency via Latent Sparsity**:
To reduce computational overhead, we will enforce sparsity in the latent dynamics. Drawing from masked autoencoder approaches (He et al., 2022), we will train the model to identify and update only the most salient latent dimensions at each step. This will be implemented via a learned binary mask over latent variables, updated iteratively during generation.
(3) **Unified Architecture for Multimodal Generation**:
We will integrate our adaptive dynamics into a single architecture capable of handling multiple modalities (image, audio, text). The core idea is to share the latent trajectory controller across modalities while using modality-specific decoders. This builds on cross-modal alignment techniques from models like Flamingo (Alayrac et al., 2022) but focuses on efficient generation rather than representation learning.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Validate Adaptive Trajectories on Synthetic Data**:
• Test the model on 2D distributions with varying local complexity (e.g., mixtures of Gaussians with sparse high-density regions).
• Measure the relationship between trajectory length and sample quality, comparing to fixed-step baselines.
2. **Benchmark on Image Generation**:
• Train on FFHQ (Karras et al., 2019) and ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009), evaluating FID and inference speed versus DDPM (Ho et al., 2020) and Latent Diffusion (Rombach et al., 2022).
• Ablate the contribution of latent sparsity by measuring the fraction of updated dimensions per step.
3. **Extend to Autoregressive Text Generation**:
• Evaluate on Wikitext-103 (Merity et al., 2017), measuring perplexity and generation latency against GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020).
• Analyze the gating mechanism’s impact on long-range coherence using the LAMBADA benchmark (Paperno et al., 2016).
4. **Multimodal Generation Tests**:
• Train jointly on LAION-COCO (Schuhmann et al., 2022) for text-to-image and LibriSpeech (Panayotov et al., 2015) for speech synthesis.
• Assess zero-shot transfer: e.g., does audio training improve image generation fidelity?
5. **Hardware-Aware Optimization**:
• Profile memory usage and throughput on TPUv4 and A100 GPUs, comparing to optimized implementations of Stable Diffusion and Transformer++ (Levine et al., 2022).
• Quantify energy efficiency (samples/kWh) as a key metric for real-world deployment.

Additionally, existing methods often rely on static latent spaces, which may not capture the dynamic, hierarchical nature of real-world data distributions.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the limitations of current generative models stem from their rigid latent representations, which fail to adapt to the underlying data manifold’s complexity. For instance, GANs’ adversarial training can lead to unstable optimization (Arjovsky et al., 2017), while diffusion models’ iterative denoising process is computationally expensive (Song et al., 2021).
Our central idea is to introduce **dynamic latent manifolds**—learnable, hierarchical representations that evolve during generation. We posit that by enabling the latent space to adaptively reorganize based on the data’s local structure, we can simultaneously improve sample quality and diversity. This approach could mitigate mode collapse in GANs and reduce the sampling steps required for diffusion models.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a three-part framework:

Inspired by Riemannian geometry (Arvanitidis et al., 2018), we will parameterize the latent space as a learnable manifold with curvature-sensitive metrics. This will allow the model to "stretch" or "compress" regions of the latent space based on data density, avoiding mode collapse.
(2) **Hierarchical Adversarial Training**:
To stabilize GAN training, we will introduce a hierarchical adversarial objective where discriminators operate at multiple scales of the latent manifold. This builds on progressive GANs (Karras et al., 2018) but incorporates manifold-aware gradients to prevent gradient vanishing or explosion.
(3) **Efficient Sampling via Learned Manifold Walks**:
For diffusion models, we will replace the fixed noise schedule with a learned manifold walk, where each denoising step is guided by the local structure of the latent space. This could reduce the number of steps needed for high-quality generation, as shown in recent work on accelerated diffusion (Lu et al., 2022).
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:

**Generative Models with Dynamic Latent Manifolds: Bridging the Gap Between Sample Quality and Diversity**
2. Problem Statement:
Current generative models, such as GANs (Goodfellow et al., 2014) and diffusion models (Ho et al., 2020), excel at producing high-fidelity samples but often struggle with mode collapse or limited diversity, especially in complex, multi-modal datasets. While recent advances like StyleGAN (Karras et al., 2020) and latent diffusion models (Rombach et al., 2022) have improved sample quality, they still rely on static or rigid latent spaces, which may not fully capture the underlying data manifold’s topology. This leads to trade-offs between sample quality and diversity, particularly in scenarios requiring fine-grained control over generative outputs (e.g., conditional generation or few-shot adaptation).
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the limitations of existing generative models stem from their fixed or overly simplistic latent space geometries. For instance, GANs often assume a Gaussian prior, while diffusion models rely on linear interpolation in latent space, which may not align with the true data manifold’s non-linear structure. Recent work by Arvanitidis et al. (2018) has shown that accounting for Riemannian geometry in latent spaces can improve generative performance, but this has not been systematically integrated into modern architectures.
Our central hypothesis is that **dynamically adapting the latent space geometry during training**—by learning a data-dependent manifold—will enable better traversal of high-density regions and improve sample diversity without sacrificing fidelity. Specifically, we propose that a learnable metric tensor over the latent space, coupled with a novel training objective that penalizes geodesic "shortcuts" between modes, can mitigate mode collapse and enhance controllability.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a three-part framework for generative models with dynamic latent manifolds (DLM):
(1) **Learnable Latent Geometry**:
We will replace the standard Euclidean latent space with a Riemannian manifold equipped with a learnable metric tensor *M(z)*, where *z* is the latent variable. This tensor will be parameterized by a lightweight neural network, enabling the model to adapt the local geometry to the data distribution. Inspired by Arvanitidis et al. (2018), we will use a positive-definite formulation via Cholesky decomposition to ensure numerical stability.
(2) **Geodesic Adversarial Training**:
To enforce meaningful latent trajectories, we will introduce a novel adversarial loss term that penalizes "shortcut" generations—samples that lie on geodesics connecting distinct modes but do not correspond to valid data. This will be implemented via a discriminator trained to distinguish between real data and interpolated samples along geodesics in the learned manifold.
(3) **Efficient Sampling via Geodesic Flow**:
We will develop a modified sampling procedure that leverages the learned geometry. Instead of linear interpolation, we will use geodesic flows (analogous to ODE-based sampling in diffusion models) to traverse the latent space, ensuring smoother transitions between modes. This will build on the work of Grathwohl et al. (2019) but extend it to non-Euclidean spaces.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Validate Latent Geometry Learning**:
- Train DLM on synthetic multi-modal datasets (e.g., 2D Gaussians with varying covariance) and visualize the learned metric tensor.
- Compare geodesic paths to linear interpolations in baseline models (GANs, VAEs) to verify improved mode coverage.
2. **Benchmark Against Mode Collapse**:
- Evaluate DLM on standard datasets (CIFAR-10, ImageNet) using metrics like Inception Score (IS), Fréchet Inception Distance (FID), and mode coverage metrics (e.g., number of unique nearest neighbors in feature space).
- Compare to state-of-the-art baselines (StyleGAN-3, DDPM) under identical compute budgets.
3. **Test Controllability**:
- Design conditional generation tasks (e.g., class-conditional ImageNet) and measure the precision-recall trade-off (Sajjadi et al., 2018).
- Assess few-shot adaptation by fine-tuning DLM on novel classes and comparing to latent diffusion models.
4. **Scalability and Efficiency**:
- Profile training time and memory usage of DLM versus baselines, focusing on the overhead of computing geodesics.
- Optimize the metric tensor network for GPU efficiency using techniques from Chen et al. (2021).
5. **Ablation Studies**:
- Ablate components (metric tensor, geodesic loss) to isolate their contributions.
- Study the impact of latent space dimensionality and manifold curvature on sample quality.

1. Title:
**Generative Models with Dynamic Latent Manifolds: Bridging the Gap Between Sample Quality and Controllability**
2. Problem Statement:
Current generative models, such as diffusion models (Ho et al., 2020) and GANs (Goodfellow et al., 2014), excel at producing high-fidelity samples but struggle with fine-grained controllability and interpretability. While latent-space editing (e.g., StyleGAN (Karras et al., 2020)) enables some control, it often relies on heuristic or post-hoc interventions that lack theoretical grounding. Additionally, existing methods for disentangled representation learning (Higgins et al., 2017) fail to scale to complex, high-dimensional data like images or video. This creates a fundamental tension between sample quality and the ability to systematically manipulate generative processes.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the limitations of current generative models stem from static, monolithic latent spaces that do not adapt to the underlying data geometry. For instance, diffusion models implicitly learn a fixed noise-to-data mapping, while GANs often exhibit entangled latent directions. Recent work on Riemannian latent spaces (Arvanitidis et al., 2018) suggests that dynamic, data-dependent manifolds could better capture hierarchical structure.
Our central idea is to **learn generative models with dynamic latent manifolds**, where the geometry of the latent space adapts to the input context. We posit that this will enable:
- **Better controllability**: By explicitly modeling latent trajectories as geodesics on a learned manifold, edits (e.g., changing attributes) can follow natural data paths.
- **Improved sample quality**: Adaptive manifolds can better capture multi-scale features (e.g., global structure vs. local details) by dynamically reweighting latent dimensions.
- **Theoretically grounded interventions**: Leveraging tools from differential geometry (e.g., parallel transport) could enable provably consistent edits.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a three-part framework:
(1) **Dynamic Manifold Learning**:
- Replace static latent spaces with a **context-dependent Riemannian metric** \( g_z(x) \), where \( z \) is the latent code and \( x \) is the input (e.g., a conditioning image or text prompt).
- Implement \( g_z(x) \) via a hypernetwork (Ha et al., 2017) that predicts a positive-definite matrix for each \( z \), ensuring the metric is smooth and invertible.
(2) **Geodesic Sampling & Editing**:
- For sampling, replace Euclidean Langevin dynamics with **manifold-aware MCMC** (Girolami & Calderhead, 2011), where proposals follow geodesics under \( g_z(x) \).
- For editing, derive closed-form geodesic equations (using Christoffel symbols) to interpolate or extrapolate latent codes along attribute directions (e.g., "smile" in faces).
(3) **Efficient Training via Surrogate Losses**:
- To avoid backpropagating through ODE solvers (used for geodesics), we propose a **surrogate energy-based loss** that approximates manifold distances with graph-based shortcuts (Bronstein et al., 2021).
- Integrate with existing architectures (e.g., UNets for diffusion) by adding a lightweight metric predictor head.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Validate Manifold Dynamics on Synthetic Data**:
- Train on synthetic datasets with known ground-truth manifolds (e.g., Swiss roll).
- Metrics: (a) Geodesic error vs. true manifold distance, (b) Attribute disentanglement score (DCI, Eastwood & Williams, 2018).
2. **Test Controllability on Image Data**:
- Benchmark against StyleGAN2 and Latent Diffusion (Rombach et al., 2022) on FFHQ and AFHQ.
- Tasks: (a) Local edits (e.g., changing eye color), (b) Global edits (e.g., pose rotation).
- Human evaluation for realism and consistency.
3. **Scale to Video Generation**:
- Extend to dynamic manifolds for video (e.g., predict time-dependent metrics).
- Evaluate on UCF-101 for temporal coherence (using FVD (Unterthiner et al., 2019)).
4. **Ablate Design Choices**:
- Compare hypernetwork vs. MLP for \( g_z(x) \).
- Study the impact of latent dimension and metric rank.
5. **Theoretical Analysis**:
- Prove that our method generalizes VAEs (Kingma & Welling, 2014) when \( g_z(x) \) is identity.
- Derive error bounds for geodesic approximations.

**Generative Models with Dynamic Latent Structures: Bridging the Gap Between Expressivity and Efficiency**
2. Problem Statement:
Current generative models, such as diffusion models (Ho et al., 2020) and autoregressive transformers (Brown et al., 2020), achieve impressive results but face fundamental limitations. Diffusion models suffer from slow sampling due to iterative denoising steps, while autoregressive models are constrained by sequential generation and quadratic attention complexity. Variational autoencoders (VAEs) (Kingma & Welling, 2014) and generative adversarial networks (GANs) (Goodfellow et al., 2014) struggle with mode collapse or unstable training dynamics. Despite advances, no existing model combines high sample quality, fast inference, and scalability to large datasets without compromising computational efficiency.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the rigidity of fixed latent structures in current generative models limits their adaptability to diverse data distributions. For instance, diffusion models enforce a predefined noise schedule, while autoregressive models rely on a static generation order. We propose that dynamically adjusting the latent structure—such as the noise schedule in diffusion models or the attention pattern in transformers—based on input context could improve both sample quality and efficiency.
Our central idea is to introduce **input-dependent latent dynamics** into generative models. Specifically, we hypothesize that:
- A **dynamic noise schedule** in diffusion models, conditioned on intermediate latent states, could reduce the number of sampling steps without sacrificing fidelity.
- **Adaptive autoregressive dependencies** in transformers, learned via lightweight gating mechanisms, could enable sparse, content-aware generation while maintaining tractability.
- A **hybrid latent space**, combining the stability of VAEs with the expressivity of GANs, could mitigate mode collapse by dynamically reweighting latent dimensions during training.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a framework for generative models with dynamic latent structures, addressing three key challenges:
(1) **Dynamic Diffusion Processes**:
- Replace the fixed noise schedule in diffusion models with a learned, input-conditional scheduler. The scheduler will predict the optimal noise level at each step based on the current latent state, using a small MLP.
- Implement a **latent guidance** mechanism to steer sampling toward high-likelihood regions, inspired by classifier-free guidance (Ho & Salimans, 2022).
(2) **Sparse Autoregressive Transformers**:
- Introduce a **gated sparse attention** mechanism that dynamically prunes low-probability token dependencies during generation. The gating function will be trained jointly with the model to balance sparsity and expressivity.
- Integrate **progressive masking** to gradually narrow the attention window as generation progresses, reducing redundant computations.
(3) **Hybrid Latent Spaces**:
- Design a **VAE-GAN hybrid** where the latent space is partitioned into stable (VAE-like) and adversarial (GAN-like) regions. A dynamic weighting network will allocate dimensions to each region during training, adapting to data complexity.
- Use **gradient balancing** to prevent mode collapse, penalizing over-reliance on adversarial dimensions.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Validate Dynamic Diffusion**:
- Train a dynamic diffusion model on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-64, comparing sample quality (FID, Inception Score) and sampling speed (steps/sec) against DDPM (Ho et al., 2020) and DDIM (Song et al., 2021).
- Ablate the scheduler design: fixed vs. linear vs. learned.
2. **Benchmark Sparse Autoregressive Models**:
- Evaluate gated sparse attention on WikiText-103 and PG-19, measuring perplexity and generation speed against dense transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017) and sparse variants (Child et al., 2019).
- Test extrapolation to sequences 2× longer than training data.
3. **Test Hybrid Latent Spaces**:
- Train VAEGAN hybrids on CelebA-HQ and LSUN Bedroom, quantifying mode coverage (recall@k) and sample diversity (intra-FID).
- Compare to pure VAEs (Kingma & Welling, 2014) and GANs (Karras et al., 2020).
4. **Scale to High-Resolution Data**:
- Apply dynamic diffusion to 256×256 images, testing the scalability of latent guidance.
- Measure memory usage and training stability.
5. **Downstream Applications**:
- Fine-tune models for text-to-image generation (zero-shot on COCO) and audio synthesis (LibriSpeech).
- Conduct human evaluations for qualitative assessment.

**Generative Models with Dynamic Latent Structure: Bridging the Gap Between Expressivity and Controllability**
2. Problem Statement:
Current generative models, such as diffusion models (Ho et al., 2020) and autoregressive transformers (Brown et al., 2020), excel at producing high-fidelity samples but struggle with fine-grained controllability and interpretability. While diffusion models offer strong likelihood-based training, their iterative denoising process is computationally expensive and lacks explicit mechanisms for structured reasoning (Song et al., 2021). Autoregressive models, on the other hand, suffer from slow inference and difficulty in enforcing global consistency (Child et al., 2019). Hybrid approaches like latent diffusion models (Rombach et al., 2022) improve efficiency but still rely on static latent spaces, limiting their ability to adapt to hierarchical or compositional data structures. There is a critical need for generative models that balance expressivity with dynamic, interpretable latent representations.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the key limitation of existing generative models lies in their fixed or overly rigid latent structures. For instance, VAEs (Kingma & Welling, 2014) and GANs (Goodfellow et al., 2014) often assume a monolithic latent space, which fails to capture the multi-scale or hierarchical nature of real-world data (Higgins et al., 2017). Recent work in neurosymbolic generative models (Dai et al., 2020) suggests that incorporating dynamic, structured latent variables can improve both sample quality and controllability.
Our central idea is to design a generative framework where the latent structure *adapts* to the input and generation task. Specifically, we propose that a *dynamic latent tree* or *graph* structure, inferred jointly with the generation process, can enable:
- **Hierarchical controllability**: Users can intervene at different levels of abstraction (e.g., editing high-level attributes or fine-grained details).
- **Efficient sampling**: By sparsifying or reconfiguring the latent structure based on input complexity.
- **Interpretability**: The inferred structure provides explicit insights into the model’s reasoning.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a three-part framework for dynamic latent structure generation:
**(1) Dynamic Latent Graph Construction**:
- Replace static latent spaces with a *learnable graph generator* that constructs a sparse, input-dependent latent graph. The graph topology (nodes/edges) will be inferred via a lightweight GNN (Kipf & Welling, 2017) conditioned on the input or partial generation.
- Key innovation: The graph’s connectivity will be *adaptive*, with edges dynamically pruned or added based on attention scores (Vaswani et al., 2017) or reinforcement learning (Zambaldi et al., 2019).
**(2) Hierarchical Diffusion Process**:
- Extend diffusion models to operate over the latent graph, with denoising steps conditioned on the graph structure. Each node will represent a latent variable at a specific level of abstraction (e.g., scene layout → object shapes → textures).
- To ensure tractability, we will develop a *graph-aware parallel sampling* algorithm inspired by blockwise autoregressive models (Menick & Kalchbrenner, 2019).
**(3) Controllable Generation via Latent Interventions**:
- Introduce a *latent editing interface* that allows users to manipulate graph nodes/edges at inference time. For example, modifying a high-level node (e.g., "object count") should propagate changes coherently to lower levels.
- Train the model with auxiliary losses to enforce consistency between edits and outputs, drawing from work in counterfactual generation (Sauer & Geiger, 2021).
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Validate Dynamic Latent Graphs on Synthetic Data**:
- Tasks:
• *Compositional MNIST*: Generate digits with controllable strokes and styles.
• *Program Synthesis*: Generate code snippets with editable logic blocks.
- Metrics: Edit success rate, sample quality (FID), and graph interpretability (human evaluations).
2. **Benchmark Against Baselines on Image Generation**:
- Compare to Stable Diffusion (Rombach et al., 2022), DDPM (Ho et al., 2020), and autoregressive transformers on FFHQ and ImageNet.
- Key tests:
• Controllability: Can users reliably edit *specific* attributes (e.g., "add glasses") without affecting others?
• Efficiency: Measure sampling speed vs. baseline diffusion models.
3. **Test Hierarchical Reasoning on Text-to-3D Generation**:
- Train on ShapeNet datasets, using the latent graph to represent 3D meshes at multiple LODs (levels of detail).
- Evaluate whether edits to high-level nodes (e.g., "chair legs") correctly propagate to geometry/textures.
4. **Quantify Interpretability**:
- Conduct human studies to assess if users can predict model behavior from the latent graph.
- Use saliency maps (Simonyan et al., 2014) to validate that graph edges align with human intuitions.
5. **Ablation Studies**:
- Ablate components: dynamic vs. static graphs, hierarchical vs. flat diffusion.
- Measure the impact of graph sparsity on sample quality and training stability.

**Generative Models with Dynamic Latent Structures: Bridging the Gap Between Expressivity and Efficiency**
2. Problem Statement:
Current generative models, such as diffusion models (Ho et al., 2020) and autoregressive transformers (Brown et al., 2020), achieve impressive results but face critical limitations. Diffusion models suffer from slow sampling due to iterative denoising steps, while autoregressive models exhibit sequential bottlenecks during generation. Variational autoencoders (VAEs) (Kingma & Welling, 2014) and generative adversarial networks (GANs) (Goodfellow et al., 2014) struggle with mode collapse or unstable training dynamics. A fundamental challenge is the trade-off between expressivity (e.g., high-fidelity generation) and efficiency (e.g., fast sampling and training). Recent work on latent diffusion models (Rombach et al., 2022) improves efficiency but still relies on iterative refinement. There is a need for generative models that dynamically adapt their latent structures to balance these competing demands.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the rigidity of fixed latent structures in existing generative models limits their adaptability to diverse data modalities and computational constraints. For instance, VAEs and GANs use static latent dimensions, while diffusion models employ predefined noise schedules. We propose that introducing *dynamic latent structures*—where the model learns to adjust its latent space dimensionality, connectivity, or noise schedules based on input complexity—can simultaneously improve expressivity and efficiency.
Our central idea is inspired by recent advances in neural architecture search (NAS) (Elsken et al., 2019) and adaptive computation (Graves, 2016). We posit that a generative model with dynamic latent structures can:
- Allocate more capacity to complex regions of the data distribution (e.g., fine details in images).
- Reduce redundant computations for simpler regions (e.g., uniform backgrounds).
- Enable faster convergence by learning task-specific latent hierarchies.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a framework for generative models with dynamic latent structures (GenDyna), addressing the problem in three parts:
(1) **Dynamic Latent Allocation**:
We will design a stochastic gating mechanism to dynamically adjust the effective dimensionality of the latent space. For VAEs, this involves learning a distribution over latent dimensions (e.g., via Gumbel-Softmax (Jang et al., 2017)). For diffusion models, we will adaptively prune or expand noise levels during denoising based on input complexity.
(2) **Efficient Training via Gradient Estimation**:
Dynamic structures introduce discontinuities that challenge gradient-based optimization. We will employ gradient estimators (e.g., REINFORCE (Williams, 1992) or straight-through estimators (Bengio et al., 2013)) to train the gating mechanisms end-to-end. To stabilize training, we will use auxiliary losses to encourage sparsity and prevent overfitting.
(3) **Hierarchical Latent Refinement**:
We will integrate dynamic structures into a hierarchical latent space, where higher-level latents control coarse features and lower-level latents refine details. This builds on hierarchical VAEs (Vahdat & Kautz, 2020) but with adaptive depth. For diffusion models, we will explore dynamic noise schedules conditioned on intermediate latents.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Validate Dynamic Latent Allocation**:
- Synthetic Data: Test on mixtures of Gaussians with varying complexity. Measure whether the model allocates more latents to high-variance modes.
- Image Patches: Train on CIFAR-10 (Krizhevsky, 2009) and measure latent usage across patches (e.g., more latents for textured regions).
2. **Benchmark Sampling Efficiency**:
- Compare sampling speed (steps/sec) and FID (Heusel et al., 2017) against static baselines (e.g., DDPM (Ho et al., 2020)) on FFHQ (Karras et al., 2019).
- Ablate the impact of dynamic noise schedules in diffusion models.
3. **Evaluate Generalization**:
- Train on ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009) and test zero-shot on out-of-distribution data (e.g., stylized images). Measure robustness via LPIPS (Zhang et al., 2018).
- Test dynamic VAEs on text-to-image generation using COCO (Lin et al., 2014).
4. **Analyze Latent Dynamics**:
- Visualize latent usage heatmaps to interpret model decisions.
- Measure the correlation between latent allocation and perceptual complexity (e.g., using SALICON (Huang et al., 2015)).
5. **Scale to High-Resolution Data**:
- Train on 256x256 LSUN bedrooms (Yu et al., 2015) with adaptive hierarchical latents.
- Compare training time and memory usage against fixed-structure baselines.

1. Title:
**Generative Models with Adaptive Latent Dynamics: Bridging the Gap Between Sample Quality and Computational Efficiency**
2. Problem Statement:
Current generative models, such as diffusion models (Ho et al., 2020) and autoregressive transformers (Brown et al., 2020), achieve remarkable sample quality but suffer from high computational costs during training and inference. Diffusion models require hundreds of iterative steps for sampling, while autoregressive models scale quadratically with sequence length. Recent attempts to improve efficiency, such as latent diffusion models (Rombach et al., 2022) or sparse attention mechanisms (Child et al., 2019), either sacrifice sample fidelity or introduce architectural complexity. There is a critical need for generative models that maintain high-quality outputs while reducing computational overhead, particularly for long-sequence or high-resolution data.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the inefficiency of existing generative models stems from their static latent dynamics—the rules governing how latent states evolve during generation are fixed regardless of input complexity or output requirements. For example, diffusion models apply the same noise schedule to all samples, while autoregressive models use uniform attention patterns. This rigidity limits adaptability and wastes computation on trivial or redundant steps.
Our central idea is to introduce *input-adaptive latent dynamics*, where the model dynamically adjusts its generative process based on the input’s inherent complexity. We posit that this adaptability will:
1) Reduce redundant computations (e.g., fewer diffusion steps for "easy" samples),
2) Improve sample quality by allocating more resources to challenging regions (e.g., high-frequency details in images), and
3) Enable scalable generation of long sequences by dynamically sparsifying attention or recurrence.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a framework for generative models with adaptive latent dynamics, implemented in three stages:
**(1) Adaptive Noise Scheduling for Diffusion Models:**
We will replace the fixed noise schedule in diffusion models with a learned, input-dependent scheduler. Inspired by Song et al. (2021), we will train a lightweight controller network to predict the optimal number of diffusion steps and noise levels for each input. This controller will be trained end-to-end with the diffusion model using a reinforcement learning objective that balances sample quality and computational cost.
**(2) Dynamic Sparsification for Autoregressive Models:**
For autoregressive generation, we will design a *dynamic sparse attention* mechanism that allocates attention bandwidth proportionally to the entropy of the sequence. High-entropy regions (e.g., novel sentence structures) will receive dense attention, while low-entropy regions (e.g., repetitive patterns) will use sparse attention. This builds on the Sparse Transformer (Child et al., 2019) but replaces fixed patterns with data-dependent sparsity.
**(3) Unified Latent Adaptation:**
To generalize across modalities, we will develop a shared latent adaptation module that can be plugged into existing architectures. This module will use a gating mechanism (similar to Mixture of Experts (Shazeer et al., 2017)) to route computations dynamically. For example, in a diffusion model, it could skip steps for "easy" latent dimensions or allocate more steps to fine-grained details.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Validate Adaptive Noise Scheduling:**
- Train a diffusion model with our adaptive scheduler on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet.
- Compare sample quality (FID, Inception Score) and wall-clock time against fixed-step baselines (DDPM, DDIM).
- Ablate the controller’s impact by freezing it after training and measuring performance degradation.
2. **Test Dynamic Sparsification in Language Modeling:**
- Implement dynamic sparse attention in a GPT-style model and evaluate on the WikiText-103 and PG-19 datasets.
- Measure perplexity vs. speed trade-offs against dense and fixed-sparse baselines.
- Analyze attention patterns to verify entropy-based adaptation.
3. **High-Resolution Image Generation:**
- Apply our unified adaptation module to a latent diffusion model (e.g., Stable Diffusion).
- Benchmark generation speed and quality on 512x512 and 1024x1024 resolutions using human evaluations and FID.
4. **Long-Sequence Scalability:**
- Test autoregressive generation on DNA sequences (Human Genome) and audio (LibriSpeech).
- Measure memory usage and throughput for sequences up to 1M tokens, comparing to Megatron-LM (Shoeybi et al., 2020).
5. **Ablation Studies:**
- Disentangle the contributions of each adaptive component (noise scheduling, sparsification, gating).
- Sweep hyperparameters (e.g., controller network size, sparsity thresholds) to identify optimal configurations.

**Generative Models with Dynamic Latent Structures: Bridging the Gap Between Expressivity and Efficiency**
2. Problem Statement:
Current generative models, such as diffusion models (Ho et al., 2020) and autoregressive transformers (Brown et al., 2020), achieve impressive results but face critical limitations. Diffusion models suffer from slow sampling due to iterative denoising steps, while autoregressive models scale quadratically with sequence length, making them computationally prohibitive for long sequences. Variational autoencoders (VAEs) (Kingma & Welling, 2014) and normalizing flows (Rezende & Mohamed, 2015) offer efficient sampling but often lag in sample quality. A fundamental trade-off exists between model expressivity (needed for high-fidelity generation) and computational efficiency (needed for scalability). There is a pressing need for generative models that can achieve state-of-the-art quality without sacrificing speed or memory efficiency.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the rigidity of existing latent structures—such as fixed hierarchical VAEs or isotropic noise in diffusion models—limits their ability to adapt to the varying complexity of real-world data. For instance, generating a high-resolution image may require fine-grained control in some regions (e.g., textures) but coarse control in others (e.g., backgrounds). Current models treat all regions uniformly, leading to inefficiencies.
Our central idea is to introduce **dynamic latent structures** that adaptively allocate computational resources based on input complexity. We propose that by enabling the model to (1) dynamically adjust the granularity of latent variables and (2) selectively focus computation on "high-detail" regions, we can bridge the expressivity-efficiency gap. This approach draws inspiration from sparse attention mechanisms (Child et al., 2019) and adaptive computation (Graves, 2016) but applies them to the latent space itself.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a three-part framework for dynamic latent structures in generative models:
**(1) Adaptive Latent Hierarchies:**
We will design a latent space where the hierarchy depth varies per input. For example, in image generation, the model could use fewer latent variables for smooth regions (e.g., sky) and more for detailed regions (e.g., faces). This builds on hierarchical VAEs (Vahdat & Kautz, 2020) but introduces input-dependent depth selection via a lightweight gating network.
**(2) Selective Computation with Gumbel-Softmax:**
To avoid the non-differentiability of discrete decisions (e.g., skipping a latent level), we will use Gumbel-Softmax (Jang et al., 2017) to make the model end-to-end trainable. The gating network will predict skip probabilities for each latent level, allowing dynamic pruning of unnecessary computations.
**(3) Hybrid Training Objective:**
We will combine a reconstruction loss (for fidelity) with a budget-aware regularizer (for efficiency). The regularizer will penalize excessive latent variable usage, encouraging the model to achieve high quality with minimal computation. This draws from recent work on efficient transformers (Tay et al., 2022).
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Validate Dynamic Hierarchies on Synthetic Data:**
- Design tasks where input complexity varies spatially/temporally (e.g., images with sparse high-detail patches or sequences with rare long-range dependencies).
- Compare fixed vs. dynamic hierarchies on metrics like reconstruction error and FLOPs per sample.
2. **Benchmark on Image Generation:**
- Train on FFHQ (Karras et al., 2019) and ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009), measuring FID (Heusel et al., 2017) and sampling speed against diffusion models (Rombach et al., 2022) and VAEs.
- Ablate the gating mechanism to quantify its impact on speed-quality trade-offs.
3. **Test on Long-Sequence Data:**
- Evaluate on text (PG-19; Rae et al., 2020) and audio (LibriSpeech; Panayotov et al., 2015) to assess scalability. Measure perplexity and memory usage vs. autoregressive baselines.
4. **Analyze Latent Adaptivity:**
- Visualize which regions trigger deeper hierarchies (e.g., via attention maps).
- Measure the correlation between latent depth and human-annotated "detail importance."
5. **Downstream Task Transfer:**
- Fine-tune pretrained models for tasks requiring detail-awareness (e.g., super-resolution, inpainting). Compare to fixed-architecture baselines.

**Generative Models with Dynamic Latent Manifolds: Bridging the Gap Between Sample Quality and Diversity**
2. Problem Statement:
Current generative models, such as diffusion models (Ho et al., 2020) and GANs (Goodfellow et al., 2014), excel at producing high-fidelity samples but often struggle with mode collapse or limited diversity, especially in complex, high-dimensional data spaces (Srivastava et al., 2022). While autoregressive models (e.g., PixelRNN) guarantee diversity, they suffer from slow sampling speeds and sequential dependencies. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) (Kingma & Welling, 2014) offer tractable latent spaces but frequently generate blurry or low-quality samples. A critical open challenge is to design a generative framework that simultaneously achieves high sample quality, broad coverage of data modes, and efficient sampling—without sacrificing scalability or training stability.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the limitations of existing generative models stem from static or overly simplistic latent space geometries. For instance, VAEs assume a fixed Gaussian prior, while GANs implicitly learn latent distributions that may not align with the true data manifold (Arjovsky et al., 2017). Recent work (Dupont et al., 2022) suggests that dynamic, learnable latent manifolds can better capture multi-modal data distributions.
Our central idea is to introduce **adaptive latent manifolds**—where the geometry of the latent space evolves during generation—enabling the model to dynamically adjust its sampling trajectory based on intermediate outputs. We posit that this approach will:
- Mitigate mode collapse by explicitly modeling disjoint data modes as separate manifolds.
- Improve sample quality by allowing fine-grained control over the generative process.
- Maintain efficiency by leveraging differentiable projections between manifolds.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a three-part framework:
**(1) Dynamic Manifold Learning:**
We will design a latent space composed of multiple sub-manifolds, each parameterized by a neural network. These manifolds will be connected via learnable attention-based transitions (Vaswani et al., 2017), enabling the model to "switch" between modes during generation. The manifolds will be trained adversarially (Miyato et al., 2018) to ensure they align with the data distribution.
**(2) Differentiable Projection Sampling:**
To enable efficient sampling, we will develop a gradient-based projection method that maps noise vectors to the nearest manifold. This involves solving a constrained optimization problem during sampling, regularized by a Lipschitz constraint (Gulrajani et al., 2017) to prevent degenerate solutions. We will use implicit differentiation (Amos & Kolter, 2017) to make this step end-to-end trainable.
**(3) Hybrid Training Objective:**
We will combine adversarial training with a reconstruction loss (for mode coverage) and a manifold consistency loss (to enforce smooth transitions). The adversarial component will use a Wasserstein loss (Arjovsky et al., 2017), while the reconstruction loss will employ a perceptual metric (Zhang et al., 2018) to preserve sample quality.

1. Title:
**Generative Models with Dynamic Latent Manifolds: Bridging the Gap Between Sample Quality and Diversity**
2. Problem Statement:
Current generative models, such as GANs (Goodfellow et al., 2014) and diffusion models (Ho et al., 2020), excel at producing high-fidelity samples but often struggle with mode collapse or limited diversity. While autoregressive models (Van den Oord et al., 2016) achieve better coverage of the data distribution, they suffer from slow sampling speeds and sequential dependencies. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) (Kingma & Welling, 2014) offer a balance but frequently generate blurry or low-quality outputs. A fundamental challenge lies in designing a generative framework that simultaneously achieves high sample quality, broad diversity, and efficient sampling—without compromising scalability or training stability.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the limitations of existing generative models stem from static or overly constrained latent spaces. For instance, GANs and VAEs often assume a fixed prior (e.g., Gaussian), which may not capture the true complexity of real-world data manifolds. Diffusion models, while powerful, rely on iterative refinement, which is computationally expensive.
Our central idea is to introduce **dynamic latent manifolds (DLMs)**, where the latent space structure adapts to the input data during generation. We posit that by learning input-dependent transformations of the latent space, the model can better navigate high-density regions while preserving diversity. This approach could bridge the trade-off between quality and diversity by enabling flexible, context-aware sampling.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a three-part framework to integrate dynamic latent manifolds into generative models:
(1) **Input-Dependent Latent Transformations**:
We will replace static priors (e.g., N(0, I)) with learnable, input-conditioned transformations. Inspired by normalizing flows (Rezende & Mohamed, 2015), we will use invertible neural networks to map latent variables to data-dependent manifolds. The key innovation is to condition these transformations on a summary of the input’s local structure (e.g., via a lightweight attention mechanism).
(2) **Efficient Sampling via Latent Trajectory Optimization**:
To avoid the slow sampling of autoregressive or diffusion models, we will formulate generation as an optimization problem over latent trajectories. Drawing from optimal transport theory (Arjovsky et al., 2017), we will train a critic network to guide the sampling process toward high-likelihood regions while maintaining diversity. This will be implemented as a parallelizable, gradient-based update rule.
(3) **Hybrid Training Objective**:
We will combine adversarial training (for quality) with a diversity-promoting loss (e.g., based on Wasserstein distance or maximum mean discrepancy). The adversarial component will use a non-saturating GAN loss (Miyato et al., 2018), while the diversity term will penalize mode collapse by comparing batch statistics of real and generated samples.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Validate Dynamic Manifolds on Synthetic Data**:
- Test the model on toy datasets (e.g., mixtures of Gaussians, spirals) where mode collapse is easily detectable.
- Compare sample diversity (measured by Jensen-Shannon divergence) and quality (FID score) against baselines (GANs, VAEs, diffusion models).
2. **Benchmark on Image Generation Tasks**:
- Train on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet (32x32 and 64x64) to evaluate scalability.
- Measure FID, Inception Score (IS), and coverage metrics (e.g., precision/recall for generative models (Sajjadi et al., 2018)).
3. **Test Generalization to High-Dimensional Data**:
- Apply the framework to text-to-image generation (using COCO captions) and audio synthesis (LibriSpeech).
- For text-to-image, use CLIP score (Radford et al., 2021) to assess alignment; for audio, use Mel-cepstral distortion (MCD).
4. **Efficiency and Scalability Analysis**:
- Compare sampling speed (samples/sec) against diffusion models (DDPM) and autoregressive models (PixelCNN).
- Profile memory usage during training (GB of GPU memory) and scaling behavior with model size.
5. **Ablation Studies**:
- Ablate components (input-dependent transformations, trajectory optimization) to isolate their contributions.
- Study the effect of latent space dimensionality on sample quality/diversity trade-offs.

**Generative Models with Dynamic Latent Manifolds: Bridging the Gap Between Sample Quality and Controllability**
2. Problem Statement:
Current generative models, such as diffusion models (Ho et al., 2020) and GANs (Goodfellow et al., 2014), excel at producing high-fidelity samples but struggle with fine-grained controllability and interpretability. While latent diffusion models (Rombach et al., 2022) and VAEs (Kingma & Welling, 2014) offer some degree of disentanglement, their latent spaces often lack semantic consistency, making it difficult to manipulate specific attributes (e.g., object shape or texture) without unintended side effects. Additionally, existing methods for controllable generation rely heavily on supervised signals (e.g., class labels or text prompts), limiting their adaptability to novel or unseen attributes. There is a critical need for generative models that balance sample quality with intuitive, disentangled control over latent factors.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the limitations of current generative models stem from static, globally entangled latent spaces. For instance, diffusion models map noise to data via a fixed Markov chain, while GANs learn implicit manifolds that are difficult to traverse semantically. Recent work on nonlinear ICA (Hyvarinen & Morioka, 2016) and geometric deep learning (Bronstein et al., 2021) suggests that dynamically evolving latent manifolds could better capture hierarchical and compositional structure in data.
Our central idea is to **learn a time-varying latent manifold** where trajectories correspond to semantically meaningful transformations (e.g., rotating an object or changing its material). By enforcing geometric constraints (e.g., isometry or group-equivariance) on the manifold, we aim to achieve disentanglement without explicit supervision. We further hypothesize that coupling this with a diffusion-based decoder will preserve sample quality while enabling interpretable editing.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a three-part framework:
**(1) Dynamic Latent Manifold Learning**:
- Design a **stochastic differential equation (SDE)**-based encoder that maps input data to a time-dependent latent space, inspired by recent advances in neural SDEs (Li et al., 2020). The SDE parameters will be conditioned on both time and input features, allowing the manifold to adapt locally.
- Introduce a **geometric regularization loss** to enforce consistency in tangent spaces (e.g., via Frobenius norm penalties on Jacobians), ensuring smooth interpolations.
**(2) Controllable Diffusion Decoding**:
- Replace the standard UNet in diffusion models with a **manifold-aware decoder** that leverages the latent geometry. The decoder will use attention mechanisms to "query" the manifold at each denoising step, similar to cross-attention in latent diffusion (Rombach et al., 2022), but with dynamic key-value pairs derived from the SDE trajectory.
- Implement **attribute-specific guidance** by projecting user edits onto the tangent space of the manifold, enabling precise control without retraining.
**(3) Self-Supervised Disentanglement**:
- Train the model using **contrastive learning** (Chen et al., 2020) on paired data with known transformations (e.g., rotated images) to disentangle latent factors.
- Use **latent clustering** (Van den Oord et al., 2017) to group semantically similar regions of the manifold, enabling unsupervised discovery of editable attributes.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Validate Manifold Dynamics**:
- Train on synthetic datasets (e.g., rotating 3D objects) and measure the consistency of latent trajectories under known transformations.
- Compare to static baselines (VAEs, GANs) using metrics like **disentanglement score (Eastwood & Williams, 2018)** and **attribute control accuracy**.
2. **Test Controllable Generation**:
- Evaluate on real-world datasets (e.g., CelebA-HQ, FFHQ) with annotated attributes (e.g., pose, smile).
- Measure **edit precision** (how well edits match targets) and **sample quality** (FID, Inception Score) against supervised methods like StyleGAN2 (Karras et al., 2020).
3. **Assess Generalization**:
- Test zero-shot control on unseen attributes (e.g., transferring edits from "smile" to "eyeglasses").
- Use **user studies** to compare interpretability against prompt-based methods (e.g., Stable Diffusion).
4. **Benchmark Efficiency**:
- Compare training time and inference speed against latent diffusion models.
- Profile memory usage during manifold updates to ensure scalability.
5. **Ablation Studies**:
- Ablate geometric regularization to quantify its impact on disentanglement.
- Vary the SDE complexity (e.g., linear vs. nonlinear drift) to analyze trade-offs between control and sample quality.

1. Title:
**Generative Models for Controllable and Faithful Long-Form Text Generation**
2. Problem Statement:
Current large-scale generative models, such as GPT-4 and PaLM, excel at producing coherent text but struggle with controllability and faithfulness to user-provided constraints (e.g., factual accuracy, stylistic consistency, or logical coherence) over long sequences. While methods like fine-tuning, prompt engineering, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) offer partial solutions, they often fail to maintain consistency across extended outputs or require extensive human oversight. Additionally, autoregressive models suffer from compounding errors, where early mistakes propagate and degrade output quality. There is a critical need for generative models that can adhere to constraints dynamically while preserving fluency and coherence in long-form text generation.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the limitations of current generative models stem from their inability to integrate explicit control mechanisms *during* generation, rather than relying solely on post-hoc corrections or static prompts. Recent work in constrained decoding (e.g., NeuroLogic decoding) and energy-based models (EBMs) suggests that incorporating real-time feedback loops can improve adherence to constraints. However, these approaches have not been scaled to long-form tasks or integrated with modern large language models (LLMs).
Our central idea is to develop a hybrid architecture that combines the fluency of autoregressive LLMs with dynamic, trainable control modules. We posit that by (1) introducing a *latent control space* to guide generation at each step and (2) leveraging reinforcement learning to optimize for constraint satisfaction, we can achieve better controllability without sacrificing generative quality.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a three-part approach:
(1) **Latent Control Space Integration**:
We will augment a pretrained LLM with a latent control module that projects user constraints (e.g., keywords, logical rules, or stylistic targets) into a continuous space. This module will be trained to predict intermediate "control signals" that bias the LLM’s token probabilities at each generation step. The design draws from [1]’s work on controllable text generation via latent interventions but extends it to long-form tasks.
(2) **Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Constraint Satisfaction**:
To optimize constraint adherence, we will train the control module using reinforcement learning (RL), with rewards derived from constraint-specific metrics (e.g., factual accuracy via entity linking, stylistic consistency via classifier scores). Inspired by [2]’s RL-based decoding, we will explore proximal policy optimization (PPO) to fine-tune the control module while freezing the base LLM to preserve fluency.
(3) **Efficient Long-Form Generation with Hierarchical Control**:
For long sequences, we will implement a hierarchical control mechanism where high-level constraints (e.g., narrative structure) guide low-level token generation. This builds on [3]’s hierarchical latent variable models but adapts them to autoregressive settings. We will also investigate memory-efficient attention variants (e.g., blockwise attention) to scale to documents with 10K+ tokens.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Validate Control Mechanism on Short-Text Tasks**:
- Test the latent control module on constrained generation benchmarks (e.g., CommonGen for keyword-guided generation).
- Compare against baselines like PPLM and GeDi to measure gains in constraint adherence (e.g., % of satisfied constraints) and fluency (perplexity).
2. **Scale to Long-Form Generation**:
- Train on long-form datasets (e.g., WikiText-103, BookSum) with synthetic constraints (e.g., "include these 5 facts in the first 1K tokens").
- Evaluate coherence via entity tracking metrics (e.g., coreference resolution accuracy) and human ratings.
3. **RL Fine-Tuning Ablations**:
- Compare RL rewards: sparse (end-of-sequence) vs. dense (per-token) rewards.
- Ablate the control module’s architecture (e.g., MLP vs. transformer) to isolate its contribution.
4. **Benchmark Against State-of-the-Art**:
- Compare to RAG-based methods (e.g., REALM) and constrained decoding (e.g., NeuroLogic) on factual consistency in QA and summarization.
- Measure trade-offs between inference speed and constraint satisfaction.
5. **Real-World Deployment Testing**:
- Deploy the model in a collaborative writing tool with human users.
- Collect feedback on controllability and fluency via A/B testing against vanilla LLM outputs.

**Generative Models with Dynamic Latent Manifolds: Bridging the Gap Between Sample Quality and Diversity**
2. Problem Statement:
Current generative models, such as GANs (Goodfellow et al., 2014) and diffusion models (Ho et al., 2020), excel at producing high-fidelity samples but often struggle with mode collapse or limited diversity, especially in complex, multi-modal datasets. While VAEs (Kingma & Welling, 2014) and flow-based models (Dinh et al., 2017) offer better theoretical guarantees, they lag in sample quality. Recent hybrid approaches (e.g., VQ-VAE-2, Razavi et al., 2019) attempt to balance these trade-offs but introduce computational overhead or architectural complexity. A fundamental challenge remains: how to design generative models that simultaneously achieve high sample quality, broad coverage of data modes, and efficient training without sacrificing scalability.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the limitations of existing generative models stem from static or overly simplistic latent space geometries. For instance, GANs often assume a fixed prior (e.g., Gaussian), while diffusion models rely on a rigid noise schedule. We argue that dynamically adapting the latent manifold structure during training—guided by the data’s intrinsic topology—could enable better mode coverage and sample quality. Specifically, we propose that a *learnable latent manifold*, where the geometry evolves to match the data distribution’s complexity, will mitigate mode collapse and improve sample diversity without compromising fidelity.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a three-part framework for generative models with dynamic latent manifolds (DLM):
(1) **Manifold Learning via Optimal Transport**: Inspired by recent work on Wasserstein GANs (Arjovsky et al., 2017) and Riemannian VAEs (Arvanitidis et al., 2018), we will design a latent space where distances are learned via optimal transport costs. This will allow the manifold to stretch or compress regions based on data density, avoiding "holes" in the latent space that lead to poor samples.
(2) **Adaptive Noise Scheduling for Diffusion**: Building on the success of diffusion models, we will replace fixed noise schedules with a data-dependent scheduler trained jointly with the denoising network. This scheduler will dynamically adjust noise levels per data cluster, ensuring balanced training across modes (similar to the idea in "Diffusion Models Beat GANs," Dhariwal & Nichol, 2021).
(3) **Topology-Aware Regularization**: To prevent overfitting and preserve diversity, we will introduce a regularization term based on persistent homology (Cohen-Steiner et al., 2007), penalizing deviations from the data’s topological structure (e.g., disconnected components in latent space).
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Synthetic Mode-Collapse Benchmark**:
• Train DLM and baselines (GAN, VAE, diffusion) on a synthetic dataset with known modes (e.g., 2D mixtures of Gaussians).
• Quantify mode coverage using metrics like Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) between true and generated distributions.
2. **High-Dimensional Image Generation**:
• Evaluate on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, measuring FID (Heusel et al., 2017) and precision/recall (Sajjadi et al., 2018).
• Ablate the contribution of each DLM component (manifold learning, noise scheduling, regularization).
3. **Long-Tail Distribution Modeling**:
• Test on datasets with imbalanced classes (e.g., iNaturalist) to assess whether DLM improves rare-class sample quality.
4. **Efficiency and Scalability**:
• Benchmark training time and memory usage against diffusion models (e.g., DDPM, Ho et al., 2020) and GANs (StyleGAN2, Karras et al., 2020).
5. **Downstream Task Generalization**:

**Generative Models with Adaptive Latent Dynamics: Bridging the Gap Between Sample Quality and Computational Efficiency**
2. Problem Statement:
Despite significant advances in generative models, such as diffusion models (Ho et al., 2020) and autoregressive Transformers (Brown et al., 2020), key limitations persist. Diffusion models suffer from slow sampling due to iterative denoising steps, while autoregressive models face quadratic computational complexity in sequence length. Recent work on latent diffusion models (Rombach et al., 2022) improves efficiency but introduces artifacts due to fixed latent representations. Hybrid approaches, such as GANs with attention (Zhang et al., 2019), struggle with mode collapse and training instability. There remains a critical need for generative models that achieve high sample quality while maintaining scalable, efficient inference.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the rigidity of existing latent representations—whether in VAEs, diffusion models, or GANs—limits their adaptability to diverse data modalities. For instance, fixed latent dimensions in VAEs (Kingma & Welling, 2014) may fail to capture hierarchical features, while diffusion models’ noise schedules are often hand-tuned.
Our central idea is to introduce *adaptive latent dynamics*, where the model dynamically adjusts its latent space structure based on input complexity. We posit that this can be achieved by:
1) Learning input-dependent latent dimensions, allowing the model to allocate more capacity to complex regions of the data distribution.
2) Incorporating content-aware noise schedules in diffusion models, enabling variable-length denoising steps.
We hypothesize that such adaptability will improve sample quality (measured by FID, Inception Score) while reducing computational overhead (sampling steps, memory usage).
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a three-part framework for adaptive generative modeling:
(1) **Dynamic Latent Allocation**:
- Replace static latent dimensions with a stochastic process that grows/shrinks based on input entropy.
- Use a lightweight gating network (inspired by Mixture of Experts (Shazeer et al., 2017)) to predict latent dimension importance scores.
(2) **Content-Aware Diffusion**:
- Replace fixed noise schedules with input-conditioned step scheduling. Train a meta-learner (e.g., a small Transformer) to predict optimal denoising steps per input patch.
- Extend this to latent diffusion by adapting the VQ-VAE (van den Oord et al., 2017) codebook dynamically.
(3) **Efficient Training via Latent Subsampling**:
- To avoid excessive memory usage, develop a gradient-aware subsampling strategy for high-dimensional latent spaces.
- Leverage techniques from sparse training (Evci et al., 2020) to prune inactive latent dimensions during backward passes.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Validate Dynamic Latent Allocation**:
- Train on synthetic datasets with varying complexity (e.g., mixtures of Gaussians with different cluster densities).
- Measure reconstruction error (MSE) and latent utilization (percentage of active dimensions).
- Compare against static VAEs and normalizing flows (Rezende & Mohamed, 2015).
2. **Test Content-Aware Diffusion**:
- Benchmark on ImageNet (Russakovsky et al., 2015) and FFHQ (Karras et al., 2019).
- Metrics: FID, sampling speed (steps/sec), and qualitative artifact analysis.
- Ablate against DDPM (Ho et al., 2020) and DDIM (Song et al., 2021).

Current generative models, such as GANs (Goodfellow et al., 2014) and diffusion models (Ho et al., 2020), excel at producing high-fidelity samples but often struggle with mode collapse or limited diversity, especially in complex, multi-modal datasets. While recent advances like StyleGAN (Karras et al., 2020) and latent diffusion models (Rombach et al., 2022) have improved sample quality, they still rely on static or rigid latent spaces, which may not adequately capture the underlying data manifold's dynamic structure. This limitation becomes pronounced in scenarios requiring fine-grained control over generation (e.g., disentangled editing) or when scaling to heterogeneous data distributions (e.g., multi-domain images or long-form text).
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the rigidity of existing latent spaces—often fixed or linearly interpolable—constrains generative models' ability to adapt to the non-linear, hierarchical structure of real-world data. For instance, GANs with fixed latent priors (e.g., Gaussian) may fail to represent sharp transitions between modes, while diffusion models with deterministic reverse processes lack flexibility in exploring diverse outputs.
Our central idea is to introduce *dynamic latent manifolds* (DLMs), where the latent space structure adapts to the input context or generation trajectory. We posit that by learning a *data-dependent* latent geometry—enabled by differentiable manifold learning and optimal transport—generative models can achieve better trade-offs between sample quality and diversity. Specifically, we expect DLMs to:
- Mitigate mode collapse by explicitly modeling multi-modal transitions.
- Enable smoother interpolations and disentangled edits by respecting the data’s intrinsic topology.
- Improve scalability to heterogeneous data by partitioning the latent space adaptively.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a three-part framework to integrate dynamic latent manifolds into generative models:
**(1) Differentiable Manifold Learning for Latent Space Construction**:
We will replace static priors (e.g., Gaussian) with learnable manifolds constructed via graph-based autoencoders (Kipf & Welling, 2016) or Riemannian flow models (Gemici et al., 2016). The manifold’s curvature and connectivity will be dynamically adjusted using attention mechanisms (Vaswani et al., 2017) to reflect local data density.
**(2) Optimal Transport for Mode-Aware Generation**:
To address mode collapse, we will formulate generation as an optimal transport problem (Arjovsky et al., 2017) between the latent manifold and data space. A key innovation will be a *mode-aware transport cost* that penalizes "shortcuts" across disconnected modes, encouraging the model to explore all regions of the data distribution.
**(3) Hierarchical Latent Refinement**:
For complex data (e.g., high-resolution images), we will hierarchically refine the latent manifold using a cascade of DLMs, where higher-level manifolds guide coarse structure and lower-level manifolds handle fine details. This builds on hierarchical VAEs (Vahdat & Kautz, 2020) but replaces fixed hierarchies with dynamic routing.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Synthetic Mode-Collapse Benchmarking**:
- Design synthetic datasets with known multi-modal structure (e.g., mixtures of Gaussians with varying separations).
- Compare DLM-based models against StyleGAN and diffusion models on metrics like mode coverage (Dhariwal & Nichol, 2021) and Fréchet Distance.
2. **Image Generation on Multi-Domain Data**:
- Train on datasets like COCO (Lin et al., 2014) or DomainNet (Peng et al., 2019), where diversity is critical.
- Evaluate sample diversity using LPIPS (Zhang et al., 2018) and human perceptual studies.

- Test if DLMs enable smoother attribute edits (e.g., changing hair color in CelebA) by measuring consistency scores (Shen et al., 2020).

4. **Scalability to Long-Form Generation**:
- Apply DLMs to text generation (e.g., GPT-3 prompts) and measure diversity via self-BLEU (Zhu et al., 2018) and coherence metrics.
5. **Ablation Studies**:
- Ablate components (manifold learning, transport cost, hierarchy) to isolate their contributions.
- Visualize latent trajectories to verify dynamic adaptation (e.g., using UMAP).

**Generative Models with Dynamic Latent Structures: Bridging the Gap Between Sample Quality and Computational Efficiency**
2. Problem Statement:
Current generative models, such as diffusion models (Ho et al., 2020) and autoregressive transformers (Brown et al., 2020), achieve impressive sample quality but suffer from significant limitations. Diffusion models require hundreds or thousands of iterative steps for high-fidelity generation, making them computationally expensive. Autoregressive models, while efficient in training, suffer from slow sequential inference due to their left-to-right generation process. Variational autoencoders (VAEs) (Kingma & Welling, 2014) and generative adversarial networks (GANs) (Goodfellow et al., 2014) struggle with mode collapse or blurry samples. There is a critical need for generative models that balance high sample quality, fast inference, and stable training without sacrificing scalability.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the rigidity of existing latent representations—whether fixed-dimensional (VAEs) or iterative (diffusion models)—limits their adaptability to diverse data distributions. For instance, diffusion models treat all noise levels equally, while autoregressive models enforce a fixed generation order. We propose that **dynamic latent structures**, where the model learns to adapt its latent space hierarchy or generation pathway based on input complexity, can bridge this gap. Specifically, we hypothesize that:
- **Adaptive computation** (e.g., varying the number of diffusion steps or latent dimensions per sample) can reduce redundant computations for simpler data regions.
- **Content-aware generation pathways** (e.g., non-sequential or hierarchical autoregressive processes) can improve inference speed without sacrificing sample quality.
- **Joint optimization of fidelity and efficiency** via a learned trade-off mechanism can outperform static architectures.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a framework for generative models with dynamic latent structures, developed in three parts:
(1) **Dynamic Diffusion Scheduling**: Replace fixed diffusion schedules with input-conditional step selection. Inspired by Imagen (Saharia et al., 2022), we will train a lightweight "step predictor" to allocate more steps to high-detail regions (e.g., faces in images) and fewer to low-detail regions (e.g., backgrounds). This builds on latent diffusion (Rombach et al., 2022) but adds adaptive computation.
(2) **Learned Generation Pathways**: For autoregressive models, we will design a mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture (Shazeer et al., 2017) where each expert specializes in a subset of tokens (e.g., nouns vs. verbs in text). A router network will dynamically select experts per token, breaking the left-to-right bottleneck. This extends sparse transformers (Child et al., 2019) with learned generation orders.
(3) **Efficiency-Aware Training**: We will introduce a loss term that jointly optimizes sample quality (e.g., FID, perplexity) and computational cost (e.g., FLOPs per sample). This builds on Goyal et al. (2023), who used similar objectives for model compression, but adapts it to generative tasks.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Validate Dynamic Diffusion**:
- Train a step predictor on FFHQ (Karras et al., 2019) and measure FID vs. step count. Compare to fixed schedules (DDPM, DDIM).
- Test generalization to out-of-distribution data (e.g., artistic styles) to assess robustness.

Current generative models, such as diffusion models (Ho et al., 2020) and autoregressive transformers (Brown et al., 2020), achieve impressive results but face critical limitations. Diffusion models suffer from slow sampling due to iterative denoising steps, while autoregressive models are inherently sequential, limiting their scalability for long sequences. Variational autoencoders (VAEs) (Kingma & Welling, 2014) and generative adversarial networks (GANs) (Goodfellow et al., 2014) struggle with mode collapse or unstable training dynamics. A fundamental challenge lies in balancing expressivity—the ability to model complex distributions—with computational efficiency, particularly for high-dimensional data like images, video, or 3D scenes.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the rigidity of existing latent space architectures limits their adaptability to diverse data modalities. For instance, VAEs and diffusion models typically use fixed-dimensional latent spaces, which may not optimally capture hierarchical or sparse structures in data (Child, 2021). Similarly, autoregressive models lack mechanisms to dynamically adjust their computational focus based on input complexity.
Our central idea is to introduce **dynamic latent structures**—where the dimensionality and connectivity of latent variables adapt to input complexity. We posit that this approach can:

We will design a stochastic process that dynamically adjusts the effective dimensionality of the latent space. Inspired by sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) approaches (Shazeer et al., 2017), latent variables will be activated conditionally based on input features. This will be achieved via a gating mechanism that prunes or expands latent dimensions, reducing redundancy.
(2) **Hierarchical Latent Graphs**:
To model long-range dependencies, we will replace fixed hierarchical VAEs with **learnable latent graphs**. These graphs will connect latent variables dynamically, using attention mechanisms (Vaswani et al., 2017) to infer edges based on input correlations. This builds on recent work in graph-based generative models (Kipf & Welling, 2016) but adds adaptability.
(3) **Efficient Sampling via Latent Subsampling**:
For faster sampling, we will develop a **latent subsampling** strategy that skips less critical latent variables during inference. This will be guided by a lightweight predictor trained to estimate the contribution of each latent dimension to output quality, similar to adaptive computation in transformers (Graves, 2016).
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Validate Dynamic Latent Structures on Synthetic Data**:
- Generate datasets with varying complexity (e.g., mixtures of Gaussians with different cluster densities).
- Measure reconstruction error and sampling speed vs. baseline VAEs/diffusion models.
- Key metric: Bits-per-dimension (BPD) on held-out data with varying latent sparsity.
2. **Benchmark on Image Generation**:
- Train on FFHQ (Karras et al., 2019) and ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009) at 256x256 resolution.
- Compare Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) and sampling time against DDPM (Ho et al., 2020) and StyleGAN2 (Karras et al., 2020).
- Ablate the impact of latent graph connectivity on fine-grained details.
3. **Test Generalization to Video and 3D Data**:
- Evaluate on video prediction (BAIR Robot Pushing (Ebert et al., 2017)) and 3D shape generation (ShapeNet (Chang et al., 2015)).
- Measure temporal coherence (for video) and structural completeness (for 3D) against autoregressive baselines.
4. **Quantify Efficiency Gains**:
- Profile memory usage and FLOPs during training/sampling.
- Compare wall-clock time for generating 1024 samples against fixed-architecture baselines.
5. **Downstream Task Evaluation**:
- Fine-tune latent representations for classification (CIFAR-10/100) and anomaly detection (MVTec AD (Bergmann et al., 2019)).
- Assess whether dynamic structures improve transfer learning by measuring few-shot accuracy.

1. Title:
**Generative Models with Adaptive Latent Dynamics: Bridging the Gap Between Sample Quality and Diversity**
2. Problem Statement:
Current generative models, particularly diffusion models and generative adversarial networks (GANs), exhibit a fundamental trade-off between sample quality and diversity. While diffusion models excel at producing high-fidelity samples, they often suffer from slow sampling speeds and mode collapse in certain domains (Dhariwal & Nichol, 2021). GANs, on the other hand, can generate diverse samples efficiently but are prone to training instability and artifacts (Karras et al., 2020). Variational autoencoders (VAEs) offer a middle ground but typically underperform in terms of sample sharpness (Kingma & Welling, 2014). There is a pressing need for a unified framework that can achieve high-quality, diverse generation while maintaining computational efficiency and training stability.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the limitations of existing generative models stem from their static latent dynamics—i.e., their inability to adaptively modulate the generative process based on input context or latent structure. For instance, diffusion models rely on fixed noise schedules, and GANs use rigid discriminator feedback, both of which may not optimally capture the underlying data manifold.
Our central idea is to introduce *adaptive latent dynamics* into generative models, where the generative process is dynamically adjusted based on the latent state and input context. We propose that this adaptability will enable better traversal of the data manifold, improving both sample quality and diversity. Specifically, we hypothesize that:
- Adaptive noise schedules in diffusion models will reduce sampling steps without sacrificing fidelity.
- Dynamic discriminator feedback in GANs will stabilize training and mitigate mode collapse.
- Learned latent transitions in VAEs will enhance sample sharpness while preserving diversity.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a three-part framework to integrate adaptive latent dynamics into generative models:
(1) **Adaptive Diffusion Schedules**:
We will replace the fixed noise schedule in diffusion models with a learned, input-dependent schedule. Inspired by Song et al. (2021), we will train a lightweight neural network to predict the optimal noise level at each timestep based on the current latent state. This network will be trained end-to-end alongside the denoising model, enabling dynamic adjustment of the diffusion process.
(2) **Dynamic Discriminator Feedback for GANs**:
We will augment the GAN discriminator with a context-aware attention mechanism (Zhang et al., 2019) that modulates its feedback based on the generator’s latent state. This will allow the discriminator to provide more nuanced guidance, adapting its critique to the generator’s current "weaknesses" and reducing adversarial instability.
(3) **Learned Latent Transitions for VAEs**:
We will introduce a recurrent latent transition model (Chung et al., 2015) into VAEs, where the latent space evolves dynamically during generation. This will enable the model to capture temporal dependencies in the data, improving sample coherence and sharpness.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Benchmark Adaptive Diffusion Schedules**:
- Train diffusion models with fixed vs. adaptive schedules on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet.
- Measure sample quality (FID, IS) and sampling speed (steps required for comparable quality).
- Compare to recent accelerated diffusion methods (e.g., DDIM, Song et al., 2021).
2. **Evaluate Dynamic GAN Feedback**:
- Train GANs with static and dynamic discriminators on LSUN Bedrooms and FFHQ.
- Quantify training stability (gradient norms, loss oscillations) and mode coverage (precision/recall metrics).
- Ablate the attention mechanism to isolate its contribution.
3. **Test Learned Latent Transitions in VAEs**:
- Train VAEs with and without recurrent transitions on sequential data (e.g., video frames, audio).
- Assess sample sharpness (PSNR, SSIM) and diversity (latent traversal metrics).
4. **Combine Adaptive Dynamics in Hybrid Models**:
- Integrate adaptive diffusion and dynamic GAN feedback into a single hybrid model.
- Evaluate on multimodal datasets (e.g., CelebA-HQ) to test joint quality-diversity improvements.
5. **Real-World Deployment and Scalability**:
- Scale the best-performing model to high-resolution datasets (e.g., 1024x1024 images).
- Benchmark computational overhead (memory, FLOPs) against baselines.
- Conduct human evaluations to assess perceptual quality and diversity.

1. Title:
**Bridging the Realism Gap in Generative Models: A Hybrid Diffusion-Transformer Framework for High-Fidelity Synthesis**
2. Problem Statement:
Current generative models, particularly diffusion models and GANs, face significant limitations in synthesizing high-fidelity, diverse outputs while maintaining computational efficiency. Diffusion models excel at capturing fine-grained details but suffer from slow sampling speeds due to iterative denoising steps. GANs, while faster, often struggle with mode collapse and unstable training dynamics. Transformers, adapted for generative tasks (e.g., autoregressive models), exhibit strong scalability but are constrained by quadratic attention complexity and struggle with long-range dependencies in high-dimensional data (e.g., images, video). A unified framework that combines the strengths of these approaches—diffusion’s fidelity, GANs’ speed, and Transformers’ scalability—remains an open challenge.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the key to bridging this gap lies in a hybrid architecture that leverages the iterative refinement of diffusion models with the scalable attention mechanisms of Transformers, while introducing adversarial training to enhance synthesis speed. Specifically, we propose that:
- A **diffusion-based backbone** can ensure high-fidelity generation by decomposing the synthesis process into tractable steps.
- **Transformer-based attention** can model long-range dependencies in latent space, improving coherence and diversity.
- **Adversarial distillation** can accelerate sampling by training a lightweight GAN to mimic the diffusion process, reducing the number of required steps.
This approach could achieve state-of-the-art realism while being computationally tractable for large-scale deployment.
4. Proposed Method:
**(1) Hybrid Architecture Design**:
We will develop a dual-path framework where:
- A **diffusion path** iteratively denoises latent representations using a U-Net with self-attention, as in Latent Diffusion Models (Rombach et al., 2022).
- A **Transformer path** processes the same latent space using efficient attention (e.g., FlashAttention) to model global dependencies. The two paths will interact via cross-attention gates, enabling the Transformer to guide the diffusion process.
**(2) Adversarial Acceleration**:
To address slow sampling, we will train a GAN to "compress" the diffusion trajectory. The generator will learn to predict the denoised output in fewer steps, conditioned on the Transformer’s latent embeddings. This builds on adversarial diffusion distillation (ADD) techniques (Meng et al., 2023) but integrates Transformer-based conditioning.
**(3) Scalable Training**:
We will optimize memory usage via gradient checkpointing and mixed-precision training. For large-scale datasets (e.g., LAION-5B), we will employ data parallelism and leverage sparse attention for sequences longer than 10k tokens.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Validate Hybrid Attention**:
- Train ablation models (diffusion-only, Transformer-only) on ImageNet-1K.
- Measure Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) and Inception Score (IS) to quantify gains from cross-attention.
2. **Benchmark Sampling Speed**:
- Compare step reduction (e.g., 50 → 10 steps) using adversarial distillation.
- Evaluate trade-offs between FID and wall-clock time against DDPM (Ho et al., 2020) and StyleGAN-T (Sauer et al., 2023).
3. **Test Long-Range Coherence**:
- Generate 128×128 videos (16 frames) from text prompts.
- Use human evaluators to score temporal consistency vs. Video Diffusion Models (Ho et al., 2022).
4. **Scale to High-Resolution Data**:
- Train on FFHQ (1024×1024) with patch-based latent spaces.
- Measure pixel-level metrics (PSNR, LPIPS) against StyleGAN-XL (Sauer et al., 2022).
5. **Downstream Adaptability**:
- Fine-tune on medical imaging (e.g., BraTS) for tumor synthesis.
- Assess utility via radiologist evaluations and anomaly detection AUC.

**Generative Models with Dynamic Latent Structures: Bridging the Gap Between Expressivity and Efficiency**
2. Problem Statement:
Current generative models, such as diffusion models (Ho et al., 2020) and autoregressive transformers (Brown et al., 2020), achieve impressive results but face critical limitations. Diffusion models suffer from slow sampling due to iterative denoising steps, while autoregressive models are inherently sequential, limiting their scalability. Variational autoencoders (VAEs) (Kingma & Welling, 2014) and generative adversarial networks (GANs) (Goodfellow et al., 2014) struggle with mode collapse or unstable training dynamics. Moreover, existing methods often rely on fixed latent structures, which may not adapt well to diverse data modalities (e.g., text, images, and multimodal inputs). There is a pressing need for generative models that balance expressivity, efficiency, and adaptability across domains.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the rigidity of current latent representations limits generative models' ability to capture hierarchical and context-dependent features. For instance, diffusion models treat all noise levels uniformly, while autoregressive models enforce a strict left-to-right dependency. We propose that introducing **dynamic latent structures**—where the model adapts its latent space organization based on input context—can improve both sample quality and computational efficiency. Specifically, we hypothesize that:
- **Adaptive latent hierarchies** can better model multi-scale features (e.g., coarse shapes and fine details in images).
- **Input-dependent transitions** in diffusion or autoregressive models can reduce redundant computations (e.g., skipping trivial denoising steps).
- **Cross-modal latent sharing** can enable more coherent multimodal generation (e.g., text-to-image synthesis).
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a framework for generative models with dynamic latent structures, addressing the above challenges in three parts:
(1) **Dynamic Hierarchical VAEs**:
We will extend VAEs with a latent tree structure where the depth and branching factors are input-dependent. Inspired by Denton et al. (2017), we will use a gating mechanism to prune or expand latent paths during inference. This avoids over-parameterization for simple data while preserving capacity for complex samples.
(2) **Adaptive Diffusion Scheduling**:
Building on Song et al. (2021), we will replace fixed noise schedules with a learned policy that predicts the optimal denoising trajectory. The policy will be trained via reinforcement learning to minimize redundant steps while maintaining fidelity.
(3) **Cross-Modal Latent Alignment**:
For multimodal generation, we will design a shared latent space where modalities can dynamically influence each other. Drawing from Ramesh et al. (2021), we will use contrastive learning to align embeddings while preserving modality-specific features.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Validate Dynamic Hierarchies on Synthetic Data**:
- Generate datasets with varying complexity (e.g., mixtures of Gaussians, fractal patterns).
- Compare our dynamic VAE against fixed-depth VAEs on reconstruction error and sample diversity.
2. **Benchmark Adaptive Diffusion**:
- Train on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet with fixed vs. adaptive schedules.
- Measure wall-clock time vs. FID scores (Heusel et al., 2017) to quantify efficiency gains.
3. **Test Multimodal Latent Alignment**:
- Use COCO for text-to-image tasks.
- Evaluate with CLIP scores (Radford et al., 2021) and human preference studies.
4. **Ablation Studies**:
- Disable dynamic components to isolate their contributions.
- Vary latent space dimensionality to study trade-offs.
5. **Scale to Large Datasets**:
- Train on LAION-5B (Schuhmann et al., 2022) to assess scalability.
- Compare against Stable Diffusion and GPT-4 on downstream tasks.

**Generative Models with Dynamic Latent Manifolds: Bridging the Gap Between Sample Quality and Diversity**
2. Problem Statement:
Current generative models, such as GANs (Goodfellow et al., 2014) and diffusion models (Ho et al., 2020), excel at producing high-fidelity samples but often struggle with mode collapse or limited diversity, particularly in complex, high-dimensional data spaces. While autoregressive models (Van den Oord et al., 2016) achieve strong diversity, they suffer from slow sampling speeds and sequential dependencies. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) (Kingma & Welling, 2014) offer tractable latent spaces but frequently produce blurry or low-quality samples. There is a critical need for a framework that simultaneously optimizes for sample quality, diversity, and computational efficiency without compromising scalability.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the limitations of existing generative models stem from static or overly constrained latent representations. For instance, GANs and VAEs often assume fixed latent distributions, which may not capture the dynamic, multi-modal nature of real-world data. Recent work by Child (2021) on hierarchical latent spaces and Rombach et al. (2022) on latent diffusion models suggests that adaptive representations can improve sample quality. However, these approaches still rely on rigid priors or costly iterative refinement.
Our central idea is to introduce **dynamic latent manifolds (DLMs)**, where the latent space topology adapts to the input data distribution. We posit that by learning a data-dependent mapping between latent variables and output samples, the model can better preserve diversity while maintaining high fidelity. Specifically, we aim to:
- Replace fixed priors (e.g., Gaussian) with learnable, input-conditioned manifolds.
- Integrate attention mechanisms (Vaswani et al., 2017) to enable cross-modal latent interactions.
- Optimize the trade-off between sample quality and diversity via a novel divergence metric.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a three-part framework to address these challenges:
**(1) Dynamic Latent Manifold Construction**:
We will design a neural network to parameterize the latent manifold as a function of input data. Inspired by Park et al. (2021), we will use invertible normalizing flows (Dinh et al., 2017) to enable efficient sampling and density estimation. The manifold will be conditioned on input features via a cross-attention mechanism, allowing it to adapt to local data structure.
**(2) Diversity-Preserving Training Objective**:
To mitigate mode collapse, we will introduce a **manifold-aware divergence metric** combining Wasserstein distance (Arjovsky et al., 2017) with a novel **local coverage term**. This term will penalize gaps in the latent space by measuring the nearest-neighbor distances between generated and real samples in the learned manifold.
**(3) Efficient Sampling via Latent Subspace Projection**:
For faster sampling, we will exploit the manifold’s structure by projecting high-dimensional latents into lower-dimensional subspaces optimized for specific data modes. This builds on the work of Kingma & Dhariwal (2018) on Glow, but with adaptive subspaces learned via reinforcement learning (RL) to prioritize high-likelihood regions.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Validate Manifold Adaptivity**:
- Synthetic Data: Test on multi-modal distributions (e.g., mixtures of Gaussians) to verify that DLMs capture distinct modes.
- Ablation: Compare fixed vs. dynamic manifolds using metrics like Inception Score (IS) and Fréchet Inception Distance (FID).
2. **Benchmark Against Baselines**:
- Train DLMs on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-1K against state-of-the-art diffusion models (Rombach et al., 2022) and GANs (Karras et al., 2021).
- Metrics: FID, Precision/Recall (Sajjadi et al., 2018), and sampling speed (samples/sec).
3. **Evaluate Diversity Preservation**:
- Long-Tail Datasets: Test on LSUN (Yu et al., 2015) to measure performance on rare classes.
- Introduce a new **Mode Coverage Score (MCS)**, quantifying the fraction of ground-truth modes captured by generated samples.
4. **Scalability and Generalization**:
- High-Resolution Data: Scale to 1024x102px images (e.g., FFHQ) using hierarchical DLMs.
- Cross-Domain Transfer: Apply pretrained DLMs to out-of-distribution tasks (e.g., medical imaging).
5. **Real-World Deployment**:
- Partner with a robotics lab to test DLMs for generating diverse, realistic environments in simulation.
- Deploy on edge devices (e.g., NVIDIA Jetson) to assess latency and memory efficiency.

Current generative models, such as GANs (Goodfellow et al., 2014) and diffusion models (Ho et al., 2020), excel at producing high-quality samples but often struggle with mode collapse or limited diversity. While diffusion models mitigate some of these issues, they remain computationally expensive due to iterative denoising steps. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) (Kingma & Welling, 2014) offer efficient sampling but typically lag in sample fidelity. A critical gap exists in achieving both high-quality and diverse generation without prohibitive computational costs. Additionally, existing methods often assume static latent spaces, which may limit their adaptability to complex, multi-modal data distributions.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the rigidity of fixed latent manifolds in current generative models restricts their ability to capture diverse data modes dynamically. For instance, GANs often converge to a subset of modes, while VAEs produce blurry samples due to overly constrained latent priors. Recent work by Child (2021) on hierarchical VAEs and Rombach et al. (2022) on latent diffusion models suggests that dynamic or structured latent spaces can improve generation. However, these approaches still rely on static priors or costly iterative refinement.
Our central idea is to introduce **dynamic latent manifolds**—learnable, input-dependent structures that adapt the latent space topology during generation. We posit that by enabling the model to modulate its latent manifold based on contextual cues (e.g., class labels or partial inputs), we can achieve better mode coverage and sample quality while maintaining efficient sampling.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a three-part framework to integrate dynamic latent manifolds into generative models:
(1) **Manifold Modulation Mechanism**:
- Inspired by adaptive normalization techniques (Karras et al., 2021), we will design a gating mechanism that dynamically adjusts the latent space geometry. This will involve conditioning the latent manifold on auxiliary inputs (e.g., class embeddings or spatial attention maps) through lightweight hypernetworks (Ha et al., 2017).
- Key innovation: Replace fixed Gaussian priors in VAEs or GANs with data-dependent Riemannian manifolds, enabling smoother transitions between modes.
(2) **Efficient Sampling via Implicit Manifolds**:
- To avoid the computational overhead of iterative denoising (as in diffusion models), we will explore implicit manifold representations (Chen et al., 2021) that allow direct sampling. This involves training a secondary network to predict manifold parameters in a single forward pass.
- Challenge: Ensuring stability during training, as dynamic manifolds may introduce gradient pathologies. We will employ spectral normalization (Miyato et al., 2018) and manifold regularization (Arvanitidis et al., 2018) to mitigate this.
(3) **Hybrid Architecture for Multi-Scale Generation**:
- We will integrate our dynamic manifold framework into a hybrid VAE-GAN architecture, leveraging the strengths of both: VAEs for diverse latent exploration and GANs for high-fidelity synthesis.
- The model will feature a hierarchical latent space where higher-level manifolds guide lower-level sampling, similar to StyleGAN (Karras et al., 2020) but with adaptive topology.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Validate Manifold Adaptivity on Synthetic Data**:
- Design synthetic datasets with explicit multi-modal distributions (e.g., mixtures of Gaussians or tori).
- Compare mode coverage and sample quality against baselines (VAE, GAN, diffusion) using metrics like Inception Score (IS) and Fréchet Distance (FID).
2. **Benchmark on Standard Image Datasets**:

- Vary the granularity of manifold adaptation (per-sample vs. per-class) to study trade-offs.

1. Title:
Generative Models with Adaptive Latent Dynamics: Bridging the Gap Between Autoregressive and Diffusion Approaches
2. Problem Statement:
Current generative models are broadly divided into autoregressive (AR) and diffusion-based approaches, each with significant limitations. AR models (e.g., GPT, PixelCNN) excel at capturing complex data distributions but suffer from slow sequential sampling and error accumulation during generation. Diffusion models (e.g., DDPM, Stable Diffusion) offer parallel sampling but struggle with fine-grained control and often require many iterative steps for high-quality outputs. Hybrid approaches (e.g., Diffusion Transformers) attempt to merge these paradigms but introduce computational overhead and training instability. The field lacks a unified framework that combines the strengths of both while mitigating their weaknesses.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the key limitation of existing generative models lies in their static latent dynamics: AR models rigidly follow a predefined generation order, while diffusion models adhere to a fixed noise schedule. Recent work (Ho et al., 2022; Kingma et al., 2021) shows that adaptive noise schedules can improve diffusion efficiency, but these methods still operate within a constrained framework.
Our central idea is to develop a generative model where the latent dynamics (e.g., generation order or diffusion trajectory) are dynamically adapted to the input context. We propose that by learning input-dependent latent transitions—akin to "attention over the generation process"—the model can allocate computational resources flexibly, enabling faster sampling and higher fidelity. This could bridge the gap between AR and diffusion models while preserving their respective strengths.
4. Proposed Method:
(1) **Dynamic Latent Scheduling**:
We will design a learned scheduler that predicts optimal generation paths conditioned on the input. For AR models, this involves predicting variable generation orders (e.g., non-left-to-right for text, adaptive patch ordering for images) using a lightweight policy network trained via reinforcement learning. For diffusion, we will replace fixed noise schedules with input-conditional transitions, building on the continuous-time formulation of (Chen et al., 2023).
(2) **Unified Training Objective**:
To train the scheduler without sacrificing stability, we will derive a variational objective that bounds the divergence between adaptive and fixed trajectories, extending the work of (Song et al., 2021) on score-based generative modeling. The key innovation is a bidirectional KL loss that penalizes deviations from both AR and diffusion baselines, ensuring the model retains their guarantees.
(3) **Efficient Sampling via Latent Compression**:
To mitigate the overhead of adaptive dynamics, we will integrate a latent compression module inspired by (Rombach et al., 2022). This module will reduce the dimensionality of intermediate states while preserving critical information, enabling faster sampling without quality loss.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Validate Adaptive Dynamics on Synthetic Data**:
• Test the model’s ability to learn non-monotonic generation orders on synthetic sequences (e.g., arithmetic expressions).
• Compare convergence rates and sample quality against fixed-order AR and diffusion baselines.
2. **Benchmark on Image Generation**:
• Train on FFHQ and ImageNet at 256x256 resolution, measuring FID and Inception Score.
• Ablate the impact of adaptive noise schedules in diffusion mode versus adaptive token orders in AR mode.
3. **Evaluate Text Generation**:
• Test on Wikitext-103 and PG-19, measuring perplexity and generation diversity.
• Human evaluations for coherence and creativity in open-ended tasks.
4. **Quantify Efficiency Gains**:
• Measure wall-clock sampling speed versus standard AR/diffusion models at comparable quality.
• Profile memory usage during training and inference.
5. **Downstream Transfer**:
• Fine-tune the model for conditional tasks (e.g., text-to-image, infilling).
• Assess zero-shot performance on out-of-distribution data to test robustness.

**Generative Models with Dynamic Latent Manifolds: Bridging the Gap Between Sample Quality and Diversity**
2. Problem Statement:
Current state-of-the-art generative models, such as diffusion models (Ho et al., 2020) and GANs (Goodfellow et al., 2014), excel at producing high-fidelity samples but often struggle with mode collapse or limited diversity, especially in complex, multi-modal data distributions (Srivastava et al., 2022). While autoregressive models (e.g., PixelRNN) guarantee diversity, they suffer from slow sampling speeds and sequential dependencies. A fundamental limitation across these approaches is their static latent space geometry, which forces all data modes to be modeled uniformly, regardless of their intrinsic complexity or sparsity. This "one-size-fits-all" latent structure limits the model's ability to adaptively allocate capacity to rare or high-entropy modes, leading to either overfitting or underfitting.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the rigidity of fixed latent manifolds is a key bottleneck in generative modeling. For instance, in image generation, simple textures (e.g., sky) require less latent complexity than detailed structures (e.g., faces), yet current models treat both equally. Drawing inspiration from Riemannian geometry (Arvanitidis et al., 2018) and dynamic neural representations (Dupont et al., 2022), we propose that generative models can achieve better sample quality and diversity by learning **input-dependent latent manifolds**—where the geometry of the latent space adapts to the local structure of the data distribution.
Our central hypothesis is: By dynamically warping the latent space’s metric (e.g., curvature, dimensionality) based on input context, the model can (1) allocate more capacity to high-entropy regions, (2) enforce smoother interpolations in low-complexity regions, and (3) avoid mode collapse by explicitly separating disjoint modes via learned topological invariants.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose **DyGeM (Dynamic Geometric Generative Models)**, a framework that integrates three innovations:
(1) **Latent Space Warping**: Replace static Euclidean/Poincaré latent spaces with a learnable Riemannian metric tensor *g(z|x)*, conditioned on input *x*. This tensor will dictate distances and geodesics in the latent space, allowing it to expand or contract regions based on local data density. We will implement *g(z|x)* via a hypernetwork (Ha et al., 2017) that predicts per-dimension scaling factors and rotations.
(2) **Geometric Regularization**: To prevent degenerate metrics (e.g., collapsing dimensions), we will impose physics-inspired constraints:
- **Volume Preservation**: Det(*g(z|x)*) = 1, ensuring no region is arbitrarily compressed.
- **Smoothness Penalty**: ||∇_z *g(z|x)||_F < ε, enforcing gradual geometric transitions.
(3) **Efficient Sampling via Geodesic Flow**: Traditional samplers (e.g., Langevin) assume Euclidean noise. We will develop a **Riemannian HMC** sampler (Girolami & Calderhead, 2011) that leverages the learned metric to propose noise along geodesics, reducing mixing time for multi-modal targets. For diffusion models, we will derive a **curvature-aware noise schedule** where the diffusion process respects the local manifold geometry.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Validate Manifold Adaptivity on Synthetic Data**:
- Generate datasets with known multi-scale structure (e.g., nested Gaussians, toroidal manifolds).
- Measure DyGeM’s ability to recover the true latent topology vs. baselines (VAE, GANs) using (a) mode coverage and (b) geodesic interpolation fidelity.
2. **Test on Image Generation Benchmarks**:
- Train DyGeM variants (GAN, diffusion, VAE) on CIFAR-10 and FFHQ.
- Metrics: FID (quality), Precision/Recall (diversity), and **manifold consistency** (how well linear latents match human perceptual distances).
3. **Scale to High-Dimensional Data**:
- Apply DyGeM to text generation (GPT-3 architecture) and 3D shapes (ShapeNet).
- For text, evaluate diversity via **self-BLEU** and coherence via perplexity on held-out prompts.
4. **Ablation Studies**:
- Disable components (warping, regularization) to isolate their contributions.
- Visualize latent trajectories (e.g., PCA of *g(z|x)*) to confirm mode separation.
5. **Efficiency Benchmarking**:
- Compare sampling speed (steps/sec) and memory usage against vanilla diffusion/VAEs.
- Profile the Riemannian HMC sampler’s mixing time using autocorrelation metrics.

**Generative Models with Dynamic Latent Manifolds: Bridging the Gap Between Sample Quality and Diversity**
2. Problem Statement:
Current generative models, such as GANs, VAEs, and diffusion models, struggle to simultaneously achieve high sample quality and diversity, often exhibiting mode collapse or artifacts. While diffusion models excel in quality, their iterative sampling process is computationally expensive. GANs, though efficient at inference, suffer from training instability and limited mode coverage. Recent work, such as StyleGAN and DDPM, has made progress but still faces fundamental trade-offs between fidelity, diversity, and efficiency. A key limitation is the static nature of their latent spaces, which lack adaptability to the complexity of real-world data distributions.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the rigidity of fixed latent manifolds in existing generative models restricts their ability to capture hierarchical and multi-scale features dynamically. For instance, StyleGAN’s disentangled latent space (Karras et al., 2020) improves control but does not adapt to input-specific variations. Similarly, diffusion models (Ho et al., 2020) rely on a predefined noise schedule, limiting flexibility.
Our central idea is to introduce **dynamic latent manifolds**—learnable, input-dependent transformations of the latent space—to enable adaptive feature extraction and sampling. We posit that this approach will:
1) Improve sample quality by allowing the model to focus on relevant features at different scales,
2) Enhance diversity by dynamically partitioning the latent space for distinct modes, and
3) Reduce computational overhead by enabling variable-length sampling trajectories.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a framework for **Dynamic Latent Manifold Generative Models (DLM-GMs)** with three key innovations:
(1) **Input-Dependent Manifold Learning**:
- Replace static latent spaces with a hypernetwork (Ha et al., 2016) that generates manifold parameters conditioned on input noise or data.
- Use a contrastive loss to ensure manifold smoothness and avoid degenerate solutions.
(2) **Adaptive Sampling Trajectories**:
- For diffusion-based variants, replace fixed noise schedules with a learned policy (similar to RL-guided diffusion (Watson et al., 2021)) to dynamically adjust the diffusion process.
- For GAN variants, employ a latent routing mechanism (e.g., mixture of experts) to select manifolds for different data modes.
(3) **Efficiency via Latent Sparsity**:
- Introduce a gating mechanism to prune irrelevant manifold dimensions during sampling, reducing compute costs.
- Leverage techniques from sparse transformers (Child et al., 2019) to scale to high-dimensional data.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Synthetic Data Validation**:
- Test on synthetic datasets with known multi-modal distributions (e.g., Gaussian mixtures).
- Measure mode coverage (as in Metz et al., 2017) and sample quality (FID).
2. **Image Generation Benchmarks**:
- Train on CIFAR-10, FFHQ, and ImageNet. Compare to StyleGAN3 (Karras et al., 2021) and DDPM (Ho et al., 2020).
- Metrics: FID, Inception Score, and precision/recall (Sajjadi et al., 2018).
3. **Efficiency Analysis**:
- Benchmark sampling speed (steps/sec) and memory usage against baselines.
- Ablate the impact of latent sparsity on compute costs.
4. **Downstream Task Generalization**:
- Evaluate on conditional generation (e.g., text-to-image) and anomaly detection.
- Use COCO for text-to-image and MVTec-AD for anomaly detection.
5. **Ablation Studies**:
- Isolate the contribution of dynamic manifolds vs. static baselines.
- Analyze manifold interpretability via latent space interpolations.

1. Title:
**Generative Models with Dynamic Latent Manifolds: Bridging the Gap Between Sample Quality and Diversity**
2. Problem Statement:
Current generative models, such as GANs (Goodfellow et al., 2014) and diffusion models (Ho et al., 2020), excel at producing high-fidelity samples but often struggle with mode collapse or limited diversity in outputs. While VAEs (Kingma & Welling, 2014) and flow-based models (Dinh et al., 2017) offer better theoretical guarantees, they lag in sample quality. The trade-off between diversity and fidelity remains a fundamental challenge, particularly in complex, high-dimensional data spaces like images or videos. Recent work (Dhariwal & Nichol, 2021) has shown that hybrid approaches can mitigate some issues, but no unified framework exists to dynamically adapt the latent space structure to balance these competing objectives.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the rigidity of fixed latent manifolds in existing generative models limits their ability to simultaneously optimize for diversity and quality. For instance, GANs often collapse to a subset of modes due to static discriminator gradients, while diffusion models rely on fixed noise schedules that may not adapt to local data geometry.
Our central idea is to introduce *dynamic latent manifolds*—learnable, input-dependent structures that evolve during generation. We posit that by allowing the model to adjust its latent space topology dynamically (e.g., expanding or contracting regions of high density based on local data complexity), we can achieve better mode coverage without sacrificing fidelity. This builds on recent insights from Riemannian geometry (Arvanitidis et al., 2018) and adaptive sampling (Karras et al., 2022), but extends them to end-to-end trainable generative frameworks.
4. Proposed Method:
(1) **Dynamic Manifold Learning**:
We will design a latent space where the metric tensor is a function of both the latent code and input data. Inspired by Arvanitidis et al. (2018), we will parameterize the manifold curvature using a hypernetwork (Ha et al., 2017) that predicts local scaling factors for the latent dimensions. This allows the model to "stretch" or "compress" regions of the latent space to better match the data distribution.
(2) **Adaptive Sampling for Training**:
To avoid mode collapse, we will integrate an adversarial sampling strategy similar to Karras et al. (2022), but with a key modification: the sampler will dynamically adjust its exploration radius based on the local manifold curvature. For regions with high curvature (indicating complex data), the sampler will focus on finer-grained exploration, while flatter regions will encourage broader coverage. This will be implemented as a learned policy trained jointly with the generator.
(3) **Unified Hybrid Architecture**:
We will combine the above components into a single framework that generalizes existing paradigms. The generator will consist of a diffusion-like noise process (Song et al., 2021) operating on the dynamic manifold, with adversarial training used to refine local sample quality. The discriminator will also leverage the manifold geometry to compute more meaningful distance metrics, as in Zhang et al. (2022).
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Synthetic Mode-Coverage Tests**:
- Design a "multi-ring" dataset where each ring represents a distinct mode. Current GANs often collapse to a subset of rings.
- Measure the percentage of rings covered by samples and the Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) within each mode.
- Compare against baselines (GAN, VAE, diffusion) to validate dynamic manifolds improve coverage.
2. **High-Dimensional Image Generation**:
- Train on FFHQ (Karras et al., 2019) and ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009), evaluating FID, Inception Score (IS), and per-class diversity metrics.
- Ablate the dynamic manifold component to isolate its contribution.
3. **Video Generation**:
- Test on UCF-101 (Soomro et al., 2012) to assess temporal consistency and long-term diversity.
- Use metrics like FVD (Unterthiner et al., 2019) to quantify performance.
4. **Efficiency Benchmarks**:
- Compare wall-clock time and memory usage against state-of-the-art baselines (e.g., StyleGAN3, LDM).
- Profile the adaptive sampler’s overhead to ensure scalability.
5. **Downstream Task Transfer**:
- Fine-tune the model for few-shot generation and anomaly detection (e.g., on MVTec (Bergmann et al., 2021)).
- Measure how well the learned manifolds transfer to new domains.

**Generative Models for High-Fidelity and Controllable Synthesis: Bridging the Gap Between Quality and Interpretability**
2. Problem Statement:
Current generative models, such as diffusion models (Ho et al., 2020) and large language models (Brown et al., 2020), achieve impressive results in generating realistic images, text, and other data modalities. However, they face critical limitations: (1) High-fidelity generation often comes at the cost of interpretability and controllability, making it difficult to steer outputs toward specific attributes or constraints (Dhariwal & Nichol, 2021). (2) Many models struggle with compositional generalization—generating novel combinations of learned concepts (Hertz et al., 2022). (3) Training and inference remain computationally expensive, limiting accessibility (Ramesh et al., 2022). There is a pressing need for models that balance quality, efficiency, and user control without sacrificing performance.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the key to bridging this gap lies in disentangling latent representations and integrating explicit compositional priors into the generative process. Prior work (Higgins et al., 2017; Locatello et al., 2019) shows that disentangled representations improve interpretability but often degrade generation quality. We argue that this trade-off stems from inadequate coupling between high-level structure (e.g., object relationships) and low-level details (e.g., textures).
Our central idea is to design a hybrid architecture that combines the strengths of diffusion models (for high fidelity) and energy-based models (for explicit control) (Du et al., 2021). By conditioning the diffusion process on energy-based constraints derived from user-specified attributes (e.g., "red car on a sunny street"), we can achieve both controllability and realism. We further hypothesize that a modular latent space—where concepts are encoded hierarchically—will enable compositional generalization unseen in monolithic architectures (Burgess et al., 2023).
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a three-part framework:
(1) **Disentangled Latent Diffusion**:
We will extend latent diffusion models (Rombach et al., 2022) by introducing a factorized latent space where each dimension corresponds to an interpretable attribute (e.g., color, shape). Attributes will be learned via contrastive objectives (Chen et al., 2020) and validated using metrics from disentanglement literature (Eastwood & Williams, 2018).
(2) **Energy-Based Steering**:
To enable fine-grained control, we will train an energy-based model (EBM) (LeCun et al., 2006) to score samples based on user constraints (e.g., "object count = 3"). During diffusion sampling, gradients from the EBM will guide the denoising process toward regions of the latent space that satisfy constraints, similar to classifier guidance (Dhariwal & Nichol, 2021) but with learned energy functions.
(3) **Compositional Training Protocol**:
We will train the model on procedurally generated datasets (Johnson et al., 2017) where objects and attributes are combined combinatorially. This forces the model to learn modular representations that generalize to novel combinations. We will also explore symbolic reasoning layers (Mao et al., 2019) to enforce logical consistency (e.g., "a cat cannot wear a hat if no hat is present").
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Validate Disentanglement and Control**:
- Train on CLEVR (Johnson et al., 2017) and measure disentanglement scores (Eastwood & Williams, 2018).
- Test zero-shot control by interpolating latent dimensions (e.g., "change object color from red to blue").
2. **Benchmark Against Baselines**:
- Compare to Stable Diffusion (Rombach et al., 2022) and GANs (Karras et al., 2021) on FID, precision/recall.
- Evaluate controllability via human studies (participants rate how well outputs match prompts).
3. **Test Compositional Generalization**:
- Create splits where test scenes contain novel attribute combinations (e.g., "spherical cubes").
- Measure accuracy of attribute binding (Hertz et al., 2022).
4. **Optimize Efficiency**:
- Profile memory usage and sampling speed vs. standard diffusion models.
- Explore distillation techniques (Meng et al., 2022) to reduce inference cost.
5. **Real-World Deployment**:
- Fine-tune on COCO (Lin et al., 2014) and test on user-provided prompts.
- Release code and pretrained models with interactive demos.

**Generative Models with Dynamic Latent Structure: Bridging the Gap Between Expressivity and Controllability**
2. Problem Statement:
Current generative models, such as diffusion models (Ho et al., 2020) and autoregressive transformers (Brown et al., 2020), excel at producing high-fidelity samples but struggle with fine-grained controllability and interpretability. While latent variable models (Kingma & Welling, 2014) offer structured representations, they often sacrifice sample quality or require restrictive assumptions (e.g., Gaussian priors). The trade-off between expressivity and controllability remains unresolved, particularly in complex domains like 3D scene generation (Poole et al., 2023) or compositional reasoning (Burgess et al., 2019). A critical gap exists in developing generative models that simultaneously achieve state-of-the-art sample quality and enable semantically meaningful manipulation of latent variables.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the limitations of existing approaches stem from static or oversimplified latent structures. For instance, VAEs enforce fixed priors, while diffusion models lack explicit latent hierarchies. Recent work (Du et al., 2023) shows that dynamic latent structures—where the granularity and hierarchy of latent variables adapt to input complexity—can improve disentanglement without sacrificing expressivity. Our central idea is to integrate dynamic latent structuring into diffusion and autoregressive frameworks, enabling models to *learn* the optimal latent granularity per sample. We posit that this will unlock:
- **Better controllability**: Users can manipulate high-level semantics (e.g., object count in scenes) without degrading quality.
- **Improved efficiency**: Dynamic compression of simple regions (e.g., uniform textures) could reduce redundant computations.
- **Interpretability**: Latent variables could align with human-understandable concepts (e.g., spatial layout or object attributes).
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a hybrid framework combining diffusion models with dynamic latent hierarchies, implemented in three stages:
(1) **Latent Structure Learning**:
- Replace fixed latent spaces with a *hierarchical gating mechanism* that allocates latent variables based on input complexity. Inspired by Mixture of Experts (Shazeer et al., 2017), we will train a router network to dynamically assign input regions to sparse latent pathways. This builds on the latent tokenization ideas from VQ-VAE (van den Oord et al., 2017) but with adaptive granularity.
(2) **Diffusion with Dynamic Priors**:
- Modify the denoising process to condition on dynamic latent hierarchies. Drawing from recent work on latent diffusion (Rombach et al., 2022), we will extend the U-Net backbone to support variable-rate latent updates, where simpler regions undergo fewer diffusion steps. Key innovation: a *sparsity-aware gradient estimator* to backpropagate through discrete routing decisions.
(3) **Compositional Training Objective**:
- Introduce a *concept bottleneck loss* (Koh et al., 2020) to align latent variables with human annotations (e.g., object labels in images). This will be combined with adversarial training (Goodfellow et al., 2014) to preserve sample quality.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Validate Dynamic Latent Allocation**:
- Synthetic datasets with varying complexity (e.g., CLEVR (Johnson et al., 2017)) to test if the router allocates more latents to complex regions (e.g., overlapping objects).
- Ablation: Compare fixed vs. dynamic latent structures on perplexity and reconstruction error.
2. **Benchmark Controllability**:
- Modify latent variables post-training to manipulate attributes (e.g., object count, lighting). Metrics:
• *Attribute alignment*: Precision/recall against ground-truth edits.
• *Sample quality*: FID scores (Heusel et al., 2017) post-intervention.
3. **Scale to Real-World Data**:
- Train on FFHQ (Karras et al., 2019) and COCO (Lin et al., 2014), evaluating:
• Inference speed vs. fixed-architecture baselines.
• Zero-shot editing (e.g., removing objects without retraining).
4. **Interpretability Analysis**:
- Use concept activation vectors (Kim et al., 2018) to quantify latent-concept alignment.
- Human studies to assess if users can predict model behavior from latent visualizations.
5. **Efficiency Optimization**:
- Deploy dynamic sparsity on hardware (e.g., NVIDIA’s Sparsity SDK) and measure wall-clock speedup.
- Compare memory usage against dense transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017).

**Generative Models with Dynamic Latent Manifolds: Bridging the Gap Between Sample Quality and Diversity**
2. Problem Statement:
Current generative models, such as GANs (Goodfellow et al., 2014) and diffusion models (Ho et al., 2020), excel at producing high-fidelity samples but often struggle with mode collapse or limited diversity, especially in complex, multi-modal datasets (Srivastava et al., 2022). While recent advances like DDPMs (Song et al., 2021) and score-based models (Vincent, 2011) have improved sample quality, they rely heavily on fixed latent structures, which may not adapt well to heterogeneous data distributions. A critical gap remains in developing generative models that dynamically adjust their latent representations to capture diverse modes without sacrificing sample fidelity.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the rigidity of static latent spaces in existing generative models limits their ability to represent complex, multi-modal distributions effectively. For instance, GANs often suffer from mode collapse due to their adversarial training dynamics (Metz et al., 2017), while diffusion models may inefficiently traverse latent spaces for diverse samples (Rombach et al., 2022).
Our central idea is to introduce **dynamic latent manifolds**—learnable, input-dependent structures that adaptively reorganize the latent space during generation. We posit that by enabling the model to modulate its latent geometry based on the data context, it can better preserve diversity while maintaining high sample quality. This approach draws inspiration from recent work on Riemannian manifolds in representation learning (Arvanitidis et al., 2018) but extends it to generative settings.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a three-part framework to integrate dynamic latent manifolds into generative models:
(1) **Manifold Learning via Adaptive Metrics**:
We will replace fixed latent spaces with learnable Riemannian metrics, where the distance function is conditioned on the input data. This allows the model to "warp" the latent space to better separate modes. Building on the work of Skopek et al. (2020), we will implement this using hypernetworks to generate metric tensors dynamically.
(2) **Efficient Sampling with Geodesic Flow**:
To sample from the dynamic manifold, we will develop a geodesic-based MCMC sampler (Girolami & Calderhead, 2011) that respects the learned metrics. This avoids the inefficiencies of Euclidean sampling in curved spaces. We will optimize the sampler using gradient-based adaptations of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (Betancourt, 2017).
(3) **Hybrid Training Objective**:
We will combine adversarial training (for fidelity) with a novel **diversity regularizer** based on the Wasserstein distance between local latent neighborhoods (Arjovsky et al., 2017). This ensures the model does not sacrifice diversity for sample quality.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Validate Dynamic Manifolds on Synthetic Data**:
- Generate multi-modal synthetic datasets (e.g., mixtures of Gaussians with varying separability).
- Compare our model’s mode coverage against baselines (GANs, VAEs, diffusion models) using metrics like Inception Score (IS) and Fréchet Distance (FID).
2. **Test on Image Datasets with Natural Multi-Modality**:
- Train on datasets like CelebA-HQ (Liu et al., 2015) and LSUN (Yu et al., 2015), where sub-groups (e.g., hair color, scene types) are known.
- Quantify diversity using precision/recall metrics (Sajjadi et al., 2018).
3. **Evaluate Scalability to High-Dimensional Data**:
- Apply the framework to text-to-image generation (e.g., COCO (Lin et al., 2014)) and measure zero-shot FID improvements over Stable Diffusion (Rombach et al., 2022).
4. **Ablation Studies**:
- Isolate the impact of the dynamic metric by fixing it to Euclidean and comparing performance.
- Vary the hypernetwork complexity to assess trade-offs between adaptability and overfitting.
5. **Benchmark Computational Efficiency**:
- Compare wall-clock time per sample against DDPMs and GANs, profiling GPU memory usage during training.

**Generative Models with Dynamic Latent Structures: Bridging the Gap Between Expressivity and Efficiency**
2. Problem Statement:
Current generative models, such as diffusion models (Ho et al., 2020) and autoregressive transformers (Brown et al., 2020), achieve impressive results but face critical limitations. Diffusion models suffer from slow sampling due to iterative denoising steps, while autoregressive models exhibit quadratic complexity in sequence length, limiting scalability. Variational autoencoders (VAEs) (Kingma & Welling, 2014) and generative adversarial networks (GANs) (Goodfellow et al., 2014) struggle with mode collapse or unstable training dynamics. A fundamental trade-off exists between model expressivity (ability to capture complex distributions) and computational efficiency (sampling speed, memory usage). No existing framework seamlessly integrates high-fidelity generation with scalable inference for long sequences or high-resolution data.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the rigidity of fixed latent structures in existing generative models (e.g., static latent dimensions in VAEs or fixed attention patterns in transformers) limits their adaptability to diverse data modalities. For instance, natural images contain hierarchical features (edges, textures, objects) that may benefit from dynamic latent representations, where the model allocates computational resources based on input complexity. Similarly, long sequences (e.g., videos or music) exhibit varying degrees of temporal dependency, which static architectures fail to exploit efficiently.
Our central idea is to introduce **dynamic latent structures**—where the model learns to adjust its latent dimensionality, connectivity, or computation pathways conditioned on the input. We posit that this approach can:
- Improve sampling efficiency by focusing computation on "hard" regions of the data distribution (e.g., high-frequency details in images).
- Enhance expressivity by allowing the model to represent multi-scale features adaptively.
- Reduce memory overhead for long sequences by sparsifying latent dependencies dynamically.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a framework for generative models with dynamic latent structures, implemented in three parts:
**(1) Input-Dependent Latent Allocation**:
We will design a gating mechanism (e.g., inspired by Mixture of Experts (Shazeer et al., 2017)) to dynamically activate subsets of latent variables based on input features. For images, this could mean allocating more latent dimensions to high-detail regions (e.g., object boundaries). For sequences, the model could learn to skip or deepen processing for specific tokens.
**(2) Hierarchical Latent Refinement**:
Building on hierarchical VAEs (Vahdat & Kautz, 2020), we will introduce a multi-stage latent space where early layers capture coarse features (e.g., global scene layout) and later layers refine details (e.g., textures). The model will learn to terminate refinement early for "simple" inputs (e.g., uniform backgrounds) and prolong it for complex regions.
**(3) Efficient Dynamic Computation**:
To avoid the overhead of conditional computation, we will develop a **latent sparsification** technique using learned masks (Louizos et al., 2018) or differentiable pruning (Zhu & Gupta, 2018). This will be paired with a memory-efficient gradient estimator to enable training with stochastic latent dropout.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Validate Dynamic Allocation on Synthetic Data**:
- Train on synthetic datasets with varying complexity (e.g., images with sparse high-frequency components).
- Measure reconstruction error and sampling speed vs. static baselines (VAE, diffusion).
- Ablate the gating mechanism to isolate its contribution.
2. **Benchmark on High-Resolution Image Generation**:
- Train on FFHQ (Karras et al., 2019) and ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009).
- Compare FID scores (Heusel et al., 2017) and sampling time against StyleGAN2 (Karras et al., 2020) and DDPM (Ho et al., 2020).
- Visualize latent activation maps to verify adaptive computation.
3. **Test on Long Sequences (Video/Music)**:
- Train on video prediction (BAIR Robot Pushing (Ebert et al., 2017)) and music generation (MAESTRO (Hawthorne et al., 2019)).
- Evaluate perplexity and generation coherence over 10k+ token sequences.
- Compare against autoregressive transformers (GPT-3) and latent diffusion (Rombach et al., 2022).
4. **Quantify Efficiency Gains**:
- Measure FLOPs, memory usage, and wall-clock time during training/inference.
- Profile dynamic sparsification rates across modalities.
5. **Ablation Studies**:
- Freeze gating mechanism: Does performance degrade to static baseline?
- Vary latent hierarchy depth: Is there an optimal trade-off?
- Test robustness to input noise or distribution shift.

2. Problem Statement:
Current generative models, such as diffusion models (Ho et al., 2020) and autoregressive transformers (Brown et al., 2020), achieve impressive results but face fundamental limitations. Diffusion models suffer from slow sampling due to iterative denoising steps, while autoregressive models are constrained by their sequential nature, leading to high inference latency. Variational autoencoders (VAEs) (Kingma & Welling, 2014) and generative adversarial networks (GANs) (Goodfellow et al., 2014) struggle with mode collapse or unstable training dynamics. A critical gap exists between the expressivity of these models and their computational efficiency, particularly for high-dimensional data like images, video, or 3D scenes.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the rigidity of fixed latent structures in existing generative models limits their adaptability to diverse data distributions. For instance, diffusion models use a predefined noise schedule, and autoregressive models rely on a static token order. We propose that dynamically adjusting the latent structure—such as the noise schedule in diffusion or the attention span in transformers—based on input content could improve both sample quality and efficiency. Our central idea is that a *content-aware latent dynamics* mechanism, where the model learns to modulate its generative process on-the-fly, can bridge the expressivity-efficiency gap.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a framework for generative models with dynamic latent structures, addressing three key challenges:
(1) **Dynamic Noise Scheduling for Diffusion Models**:
We will replace the fixed noise schedule in diffusion models with an input-conditional scheduler. Inspired by Nichol & Dhariwal (2021), we will train a lightweight policy network to predict the optimal noise level at each denoising step based on the intermediate latent state. This should reduce the number of steps required for high-quality synthesis.
(2) **Adaptive Autoregressive Ordering**:
For autoregressive models, we will design a learned token-ordering mechanism similar to XLNet (Yang et al., 2019) but with dynamic reordering during inference. The model will predict a permutation of the generation sequence at each step, allowing it to prioritize high-information regions (e.g., object edges in images) first.
(3) **Hybrid Latent Spaces**:
We will combine the strengths of VAEs and GANs by introducing a hybrid latent space where the structure (e.g., dimensionality, sparsity) adapts to the data. This builds on VQ-VAE (van den Oord et al., 2017) but with a dynamic codebook that grows or shrinks based on input complexity.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Validate Dynamic Noise Scheduling**:
- Train a diffusion model with our dynamic scheduler on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet.
- Compare sample quality (FID, Inception Score) and wall-clock time against DDPM (Ho et al., 2020) and DDIM (Song et al., 2021).
- Ablate the policy network’s architecture to isolate its contribution.
2. **Test Adaptive Autoregressive Ordering**:
- Implement our dynamic ordering mechanism on a GPT-style image transformer (Chen et al., 2020).
- Measure perplexity and generation speed on FFHQ (Karras et al., 2019) at resolutions from 64x64 to 256x256.
- Analyze attention maps to verify that the model prioritizes semantically meaningful regions.
3. **Evaluate Hybrid Latent Spaces**:
- Train a VAE-GAN hybrid with dynamic codebook size on LSUN bedrooms (Yu et al., 2015).
- Quantify mode coverage using precision/recall metrics (Sajjadi et al., 2018) and compare to static VQ-VAE.
4. **Benchmark Against State-of-the-Art**:
- Conduct large-scale comparisons on FFHQ, ImageNet, and COCO (Lin et al., 2014) against StyleGAN3 (Karras et al., 2021), Latent Diffusion (Rombach et al., 2022), and autoregressive baselines.
- Measure trade-offs between FID, sampling speed, and training stability.
5. **Real-World Deployment Tests**:
- Deploy our dynamic diffusion model for text-to-image generation, measuring user preference (A/B testing) against Stable Diffusion (Rombach et al., 2022).
- Profile memory usage and latency on edge devices (e.g., smartphones) to assess practicality.

**Generative Models with Dynamic Latent Manifolds: Bridging the Gap Between Sample Quality and Diversity**
2. Problem Statement:
Current generative models, such as GANs (Goodfellow et al., 2014) and diffusion models (Ho et al., 2020), excel at producing high-fidelity samples but often struggle with mode collapse or limited diversity. While VAEs (Kingma & Welling, 2014) and autoregressive models (Van den Oord et al., 2016) offer better coverage of the data distribution, they lag in sample quality. The trade-off between quality and diversity remains unresolved, particularly in complex, high-dimensional domains like 3D object generation or long-form video synthesis. Additionally, existing methods lack interpretable control over latent representations, limiting their applicability in downstream tasks requiring fine-grained manipulation.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the limitations of current generative models stem from static or overly constrained latent spaces. For instance, GANs often map diverse data modes to a rigid latent distribution, while VAEs impose restrictive Gaussian priors. Recent work by Karras et al. (2021) on style-based GANs shows that disentangled latent spaces improve control but do not fully address diversity.
Our central idea is to introduce **dynamic latent manifolds**—learned, data-dependent structures that adapt to the input’s intrinsic geometry. We posit that by (1) explicitly modeling the latent space as a time-varying or input-conditioned manifold and (2) incorporating topological constraints (e.g., persistent homology; Bronstein et al., 2021), we can achieve both high-quality and diverse generation. This approach could bridge the gap between adversarial and likelihood-based methods while enabling interpretable latent traversals.
4. Proposed Method:
(1) **Manifold Learning via Geometric Priors**:
We will extend VAEs and GANs by replacing their fixed latent priors with learnable manifolds. For VAEs, we will use Riemannian metric learning (Arvanitidis et al., 2018) to enforce smoothness and curvature constraints. For GANs, we will condition the generator on latent trajectories derived from ordinary differential equations (Grathwohl et al., 2019), enabling continuous interpolation between modes.
(2) **Topological Regularization**:
To prevent mode collapse, we will penalize discrepancies between the topological features (e.g., Betti numbers) of the generated and real data distributions. This builds on work by Moor et al. (2020) but adapts it for minibatch training via approximate persistent homology computations.
(3) **Hybrid Training Objective**:
We will combine adversarial training with a novel **diversity-aware likelihood** term. Inspired by the Pareto fronts in multi-objective optimization (Mahapatra & Rajan, 2020), this term will balance sample quality and diversity by dynamically reweighting losses based on the model’s current performance.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Synthetic Data Validation**:
- Test on 2D toy datasets (e.g., circles, spirals) where mode collapse is easily detectable.

**Generative Models with Latent Diffusion: Bridging the Gap Between Quality and Efficiency**
2. Problem Statement:
Current generative models, particularly diffusion models, achieve remarkable sample quality but suffer from high computational costs during inference. While recent advances like Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) (Rombach et al., 2022) improve efficiency by operating in compressed latent spaces, they still face trade-offs between sample fidelity, diversity, and computational overhead. Additionally, existing methods struggle with fine-grained control over generation, such as disentangling attributes (e.g., style and content) or dynamically adapting to user-specified constraints. There is a pressing need for generative models that balance high-quality synthesis with practical efficiency and controllability.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the inefficiency of diffusion models stems from their reliance on high-dimensional pixel-space denoising and fixed, handcrafted noise schedules. Recent work (Ho et al., 2020; Song et al., 2021) shows that diffusion models can be reparameterized for faster sampling, but these approaches often degrade sample quality. We propose that integrating **adaptive noise schedules** and **learnable latent representations** can bridge this gap.
Our central idea is twofold:
1) **Dynamic Noise Scheduling**: Instead of fixed schedules, we hypothesize that input-conditional noise schedules can optimize computational resources by focusing on semantically meaningful generation stages.
2) **Disentangled Latent Spaces**: Inspired by VAEs (Kingma & Welling, 2014) and GANs (Goodfellow et al., 2014), we posit that explicitly modeling disentangled factors in the latent space will enable finer control over generation without sacrificing quality.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a novel framework, **Adaptive Latent Diffusion (ALD)**, with three key components:
**1. Learnable Noise Scheduling**:
We replace fixed noise schedules with a lightweight neural scheduler that predicts step-wise noise levels conditioned on the input latent. This scheduler will be trained end-to-end alongside the diffusion model, optimizing for both sample quality and step efficiency.
**2. Disentangled Latent Diffusion**:
Building on LDMs, we introduce a hierarchical latent space where global (e.g., scene layout) and local (e.g., object details) factors are separately modeled. This involves:
- A **split latent encoder** to decompose inputs into semantically meaningful subspaces.
- A **factor-aware diffusion process** where noise is applied selectively to different subspaces.
**3. Efficient Sampling via Latent Subspace Parallelism**:
To accelerate inference, we exploit the disentangled latent structure to parallelize denoising steps for independent factors. This reduces sequential dependencies and enables sub-linear scaling with respect to latent dimensionality.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Validate Adaptive Noise Schedules**:
- Train ALD on FFHQ (Karras et al., 2019) and compare against fixed-schedule baselines (DDIM, DPM-Solver).
- Metrics: FID, sampling speed (steps/sec), and perceptual quality (LPIPS).
- Ablate scheduler architecture (MLP vs. Transformer).
2. **Quantify Disentanglement**:
- Use synthetic datasets (e.g., dSprites) with known ground-truth factors.
- Measure disentanglement via mutual information gaps (Chen et al., 2018).
- Test controllability by interpolating latent subspaces (e.g., modifying "color" while fixing "shape").
3. **Benchmark on High-Resolution Generation**:
- Train on ImageNet-256 (Russakovsky et al., 2015) and LAION-5B (Schuhmann et al., 2022).
- Compare to state-of-the-art (Stable Diffusion, Imagen) in terms of FID, CLIP score, and human evaluations.
4. **Efficiency Analysis**:
- Profile memory usage and FLOPs during inference.
- Compare parallel subspace denoising to sequential baselines.
- Measure trade-offs between latent compression and reconstruction fidelity.
5. **Downstream Applications**:
- Test ALD for text-to-image generation with fine-grained control (e.g., "change only the foreground object").
- Evaluate on video prediction (extending ALD to spatiotemporal latents).

**Generative Models with Dynamic Latent Manifolds: Bridging the Gap Between Sample Quality and Diversity**
2. Problem Statement:
Current generative models, such as GANs, VAEs, and diffusion models, struggle to simultaneously achieve high sample quality and diversity. GANs often suffer from mode collapse, where they generate limited variations of samples, while VAEs tend to produce blurry outputs due to their restrictive latent space assumptions. Diffusion models, though powerful, are computationally expensive and may still exhibit trade-offs between fidelity and diversity. Additionally, existing methods lack explicit mechanisms to adapt their latent representations dynamically based on the complexity of the data distribution, leading to suboptimal generation performance for multi-modal or hierarchical data.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the limitations of current generative models stem from their static latent space formulations, which do not adapt to the local structure of the data manifold. For instance, VAEs assume a fixed prior (e.g., Gaussian), while GANs rely on implicit latent distributions that may not capture hierarchical or multi-scale features effectively.
Our central idea is to introduce **dynamic latent manifolds (DLMs)**, where the latent space structure adapts based on the input or generation context. We posit that by enabling the model to dynamically adjust its latent space geometry—such as varying the dimensionality or curvature of the manifold—it can better capture complex data distributions. This adaptability could bridge the gap between sample quality and diversity, particularly for datasets with heterogeneous modes or long-tailed distributions.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a three-part framework for generative models with dynamic latent manifolds:
(1) **Manifold Adaptation Mechanism**:
We will design a learnable function that maps input data or intermediate features to parameters governing the latent manifold (e.g., curvature, dimensionality). Inspired by Riemannian geometry, we will use hyperbolic spaces for hierarchical data and Euclidean subspaces for local modes. This builds on work by Nagano et al. (2019) on hyperbolic embeddings but extends it to generative settings.
(2) **Stable Training for Dynamic Manifolds**:
Training generative models with dynamic manifolds introduces challenges, such as gradient instability due to varying latent topologies. We will adopt techniques from optimal transport (OT) to regularize the latent space transitions, similar to the approach in Tong et al. (2020), but with modifications for dynamic settings. We will also explore contrastive losses to ensure smooth transitions between manifold states.
(3) **Efficient Sampling via Adaptive Hierarchical Priors**:
To enable efficient sampling, we will develop a hierarchical prior where coarse-level manifolds guide fine-level generation. This draws inspiration from Vahdat et al. (2021)'s work on hierarchical VAEs but incorporates dynamic manifold switching. We will use sparse attention mechanisms to reduce computational overhead during sampling.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Validate Manifold Adaptability on Synthetic Data**:
- Generate synthetic datasets with known multi-modal or hierarchical structure (e.g., nested clusters, tree-like data).
- Test whether DLMs can recover the ground-truth manifold dynamics by measuring reconstruction error and mode coverage.
2. **Benchmark on Standard Generative Tasks**:
- Compare DLMs against baselines (GANs, VAEs, diffusion models) on CIFAR-10, ImageNet, and LSUN datasets.
- Metrics: FID, Inception Score (IS), and precision/recall for diversity (Sajjadi et al., 2018).
3. **Test on Long-Tailed and Multi-Modal Data**:
- Evaluate on datasets like iNaturalist (long-tailed) and CelebA-HQ (multi-attribute).
- Measure how well DLMs capture rare modes compared to class-conditional GANs (e.g., BigGAN).
4. **Ablation Studies**:
- Isolate the contribution of manifold dynamics by freezing adaptation mechanisms.
- Vary the latent space dimensionality and curvature to study their impact on sample quality.
5. **Efficiency and Scalability Analysis**:
- Profile training and sampling times against diffusion models (e.g., DDPM) and autoregressive models (e.g., PixelCNN).
- Measure memory usage during dynamic manifold switching.

**Generative Models with Dynamic Latent Manifolds: Bridging the Gap Between Sample Quality and Diversity**
2. Problem Statement:
Current generative models, such as GANs (Goodfellow et al., 2014) and diffusion models (Ho et al., 2020), excel at producing high-fidelity samples but often struggle with mode collapse or limited diversity, especially in complex, high-dimensional data spaces. While variational autoencoders (VAEs) (Kingma & Welling, 2014) and flow-based models (Dinh et al., 2017) offer better theoretical guarantees, they lag in sample quality. A fundamental limitation is the static nature of their latent spaces, which cannot adapt to the varying complexity of real-world data distributions. This creates a trade-off between sample quality and diversity that remains unresolved.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the rigidity of fixed latent manifolds in existing generative models limits their ability to capture multi-modal and hierarchical data structures. For instance, GANs often fail to preserve rare modes, while VAEs suffer from blurry samples due to overly simplistic priors. Recent work by Arvanitidis et al. (2018) shows that latent space geometry plays a critical role in generative performance, but current methods do not dynamically adjust this geometry during generation.
Our central idea is to introduce *dynamic latent manifolds*—learnable, input-dependent transformations of the latent space that adapt to local data density. We posit that by allowing the manifold to warp based on the input’s complexity, the model can better preserve rare modes and generate sharper samples without sacrificing diversity. This approach could bridge the gap between the sample quality of diffusion models and the diversity guarantees of VAEs.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a three-part framework to integrate dynamic latent manifolds into generative models:
(1) **Manifold Learning via Riemannian Flow**:
We will extend normalizing flows (Rezende & Mohamed, 2015) to operate on Riemannian manifolds, where the metric tensor is learned as a function of the input. This will enable the latent space to adapt its geometry locally, guided by the data density. The key innovation is a *metric predictor network* that outputs a per-point curvature tensor, allowing the flow to warp the manifold dynamically.
(2) **Stochastic Regularization for Mode Preservation**:
To prevent overfitting to dominant modes, we will introduce a stochastic regularization term inspired by the "repelling forces" idea from Salimans et al. (2016). This term will penalize the collapse of latent trajectories into high-density regions, encouraging the model to preserve low-density modes.
(3) **Hybrid Training with Diffusion Priors**:
We will combine our dynamic manifold with a diffusion-based decoder (similar to Rombach et al., 2022) to leverage the strengths of both approaches. The diffusion process will refine samples generated from the dynamic manifold, ensuring high fidelity while the manifold ensures diversity.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Validate Dynamic Manifolds on Synthetic Data**:
- Test the model on synthetic multi-modal distributions (e.g., mixtures of Gaussians with varying separability).
- Compare mode coverage and sample quality against baselines (GANs, VAEs, diffusion models).
- Measure the *latent distortion* (how much the manifold warps) to verify adaptivity.
2. **Benchmark on Image Datasets**:
- Train on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet at 64x64 resolution.
- Evaluate using FID (Heusel et al., 2017) and precision/recall metrics (Sajjadi et al., 2018).
- Ablate the contribution of the metric predictor by fixing it to a static manifold.
3. **Test Mode Preservation on Long-Tail Distributions**:
- Use datasets with imbalanced classes (e.g., iNaturalist).
- Quantify minority-class sample quality and diversity via per-class FID.
4. **Scalability to High-Dimensional Data**:
- Scale to 256x256 images and video generation (UCF-101).
- Profile memory usage and training time versus static-manifold baselines.
5. **Downstream Task Generalization**:
- Fine-tune the model for few-shot generation and anomaly detection.
- Compare to pretrained diffusion models and GANs on task-specific metrics.

**Generative Models with Dynamic Latent Structures: Bridging the Gap Between Flexibility and Control**
2. Problem Statement:
Current generative models, such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) (Kingma & Welling, 2014) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) (Goodfellow et al., 2014), excel at capturing complex data distributions but often struggle with fine-grained control over generation. Diffusion models (Ho et al., 2020) have shown promise in quality but suffer from slow sampling speeds. A critical limitation across these frameworks is their static latent representations, which lack adaptability during generation. For instance, VAEs enforce a fixed prior, while GANs and diffusion models operate on rigid latent spaces, limiting their ability to dynamically adjust to user inputs or contextual cues. This rigidity hampers applications requiring interactive or conditional generation, such as creative design or personalized content creation.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that introducing *dynamic latent structures*—where the latent space adapts during generation based on input conditions or intermediate outputs—can significantly improve controllability without sacrificing sample quality. Prior work on hierarchical VAEs (Sønderby et al., 2016) and conditional GANs (Mirza & Osindero, 2014) has shown partial success but remains limited by predefined conditioning mechanisms. Our central idea is to integrate *learnable latent dynamics* into generative frameworks, enabling the model to iteratively refine its latent representation in response to feedback or constraints. We posit that this approach will bridge the trade-off between flexibility (e.g., diverse outputs) and control (e.g., adherence to user specifications), particularly in scenarios like multi-modal generation or iterative refinement tasks.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a three-part framework for dynamic latent generative models:
(1) **Latent Adaptation Mechanism**:
We will design a recurrent latent update rule that modifies the latent representation at each generation step. Inspired by work on iterative refinement in diffusion models (Song et al., 2021), we will replace static noise sampling with a learned transition function that adjusts the latent code based on intermediate outputs. This function will be trained to minimize a hybrid loss combining adversarial (for quality) and reconstruction (for fidelity) terms.
(2) **Condition-Aware Latent Dynamics**:
To enable user control, we will extend the latent adaptation mechanism to incorporate external conditions (e.g., text prompts or sketches) as dynamic inputs. Drawing from cross-attention in latent diffusion models (Rombach et al., 2022), we will implement a gating mechanism that selectively integrates condition-specific features into the latent update. This will allow the model to balance condition adherence and generation diversity.
(3) **Efficient Sampling via Latent Compression**:
To address the computational overhead of dynamic latents, we will develop a compressed latent representation using vector quantization (Van Den Oord et al., 2017). By discretizing the latent space and employing a lightweight transformer to model transitions between quantized states, we aim to retain adaptability while reducing memory and compute costs.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Validate Latent Dynamics on Synthetic Data**:
- Design synthetic tasks where static latents fail (e.g., generating sequences with evolving constraints).
- Compare our dynamic latent model against VAEs and GANs on controllability metrics (e.g., precision in meeting constraints).
2. **Test on Multi-Modal Generation**:
- Train models on datasets with paired modalities (e.g., text-to-image on COCO (Lin et al., 2014)).
- Evaluate using FID (Heusel et al., 2017) and user studies for adherence to text conditions.
3. **Benchmark Sampling Speed and Quality**:
- Compare sampling speed (steps/sec) and output quality (FID, IS) against diffusion models and GANs on CIFAR-10 and FFHQ.
- Ablate the impact of latent compression on speed-accuracy trade-offs.
4. **Evaluate on Interactive Generation Tasks**:
- Simulate user feedback loops (e.g., iterative image editing) and measure convergence speed to desired outputs.
- Benchmark against reinforcement learning-based approaches (Jaques et al., 2019).
5. **Ablation Studies**:
- Isolate the contribution of each dynamic component (e.g., latent updates vs. condition gating).
- Analyze latent trajectory visualizations to interpret model behavior.
