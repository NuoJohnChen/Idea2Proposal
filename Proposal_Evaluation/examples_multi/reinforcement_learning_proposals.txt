1. Title:
**Efficient Reinforcement Learning with Adaptive Model-Based Priors**
2. Problem Statement:
Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in domains like games and robotics, but its sample inefficiency remains a critical limitation. Model-free RL methods often require millions of interactions to learn effective policies, making them impractical for real-world applications where data collection is expensive or risky. While model-based RL (MBRL) can improve sample efficiency by learning a dynamics model, existing approaches struggle with compounding errors in long-horizon planning and fail to generalize across diverse tasks. Current hybrid methods that combine model-free and model-based RL either rely on handcrafted priors or lack adaptability, limiting their scalability. There is a pressing need for a framework that dynamically integrates learned models with policy optimization while mitigating model bias.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the key to bridging the sample efficiency gap lies in adaptive, uncertainty-aware model utilization. Prior work (e.g., Nagabandi et al., 2018) shows that MBRL can accelerate learning but suffers from model inaccuracies. Meanwhile, model-free methods (e.g., Schulman et al., 2017) excel at asymptotic performance but are data-hungry. We posit that a learned dynamics model should not be treated as a fixed prior but as a flexible component that adapts its influence based on its own uncertainty and the agent’s learning progress.
Our central idea is to develop a *dynamic weighting mechanism* that automatically adjusts the reliance on model-based versus model-free updates during training. By quantifying epistemic uncertainty in the model and aligning it with policy gradient updates, we can mitigate harmful model bias while preserving sample efficiency. This approach could unlock scalable RL for complex, real-world environments where neither purely model-free nor model-based methods suffice.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a three-part framework for adaptive model-based RL:
(1) **Uncertainty-Calibrated Model Learning**:
We will train an ensemble of probabilistic dynamics models (Chua et al., 2018) to estimate epistemic uncertainty. The ensemble disagreement will serve as a signal for model reliability. To prevent overfitting, we will incorporate regularization techniques inspired by variational inference (Depeweg et al., 2017).
(2) **Dynamic Policy-Update Weighting**:
We will derive a theoretically grounded weighting scheme that interpolates between model-free and model-based policy updates. The weight will depend on:
- The model’s uncertainty for the current state-action pair.
- The agent’s recent learning progress (measured by advantage estimates).
This builds on the policy gradient theorem (Sutton et al., 2000) but introduces adaptive bias-variance trade-offs.
(3) **Stabilized Long-Horizon Rollouts**:
To address compounding errors, we will implement a *rollout truncation* strategy. Model-based rollouts will be dynamically shortened in regions of high uncertainty, with fallback to model-free targets. This hybrid approach combines the benefits of short-horizon model accuracy with long-horizon model-free value estimation.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Validate Uncertainty Estimation**:
- Train ensemble models on benchmark tasks (MuJoCo, Atari) and measure correlation between ensemble disagreement and model error.
- Compare to baselines (e.g., Bayesian neural networks) to verify our uncertainty quantification is both accurate and computationally efficient.
2. **Ablate Weighting Mechanisms**:
- Test fixed vs. dynamic weighting schemes on continuous control tasks.
- Measure sample efficiency (episodes to threshold performance) and final policy robustness.
3. **Evaluate on Long-Horizon Tasks**:
- Deploy our method on sparse-reward navigation and robotic manipulation (e.g., MetaWorld).
- Benchmark against pure model-free (PPO), model-based (PETS), and hybrid (MBPO) approaches.
4. **Scalability to High-Dimensional Spaces**:
- Test on vision-based RL (e.g., DeepMind Control Suite) to assess whether our method can handle complex observations.
- Analyze computational overhead relative to model-free baselines.
5. **Real-World Transfer**:
- Collaborate with robotics labs to deploy our method on a physical robot arm for peg-in-hole tasks.
- Quantify data reduction and robustness to sim-to-real gaps compared to traditional RL.

1. Title:
**Efficient Reinforcement Learning with Adaptive Model-Based Priors**
2. Problem Statement:
Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in domains like games (Silver et al., 2018) and robotics (Levine et al., 2016). However, sample inefficiency remains a critical bottleneck, particularly in sparse-reward or high-dimensional environments. Model-free RL methods often require millions of interactions, while model-based RL (MBRL) approaches struggle with compounding model errors (Janner et al., 2019). Existing hybrid methods (e.g., MuZero; Schrittwieser et al., 2020) mitigate this by learning latent dynamics but are computationally expensive and lack mechanisms to adaptively balance model reliance. A key open challenge is to develop RL algorithms that dynamically adjust their dependence on learned models to maximize sample efficiency without sacrificing asymptotic performance.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the sample inefficiency of RL stems from rigid architectures that fail to adaptively leverage model-based priors during different phases of learning. For instance, early exploration might benefit heavily from model-based rollouts, while fine-tuning near convergence may require model-free policy gradients to avoid bias. Prior work (e.g., STEVE; Buckman et al., 2018) shows that adaptive weighting of model rollouts can help, but these methods lack principled mechanisms to adjust the *type* of prior (e.g., physics-based vs. learned) or its influence dynamically.
Our central idea is to introduce *adaptive gating* for model-based priors, where the RL agent learns to modulate its reliance on different priors based on uncertainty estimates and task progress. We predict that this will:
1) Reduce sample complexity by 50% or more in sparse-reward tasks compared to PPO or SAC baselines,
2) Outperform fixed hybrid approaches (e.g., MBPO; Janner et al., 2019) by avoiding over-reliance on inaccurate models, and
3) Scale to complex environments by leveraging hierarchical priors (e.g., object-centric dynamics for robotics).
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a three-part framework:
**(1) Uncertainty-Aware Gating Mechanism**:
- Design a gating network that takes as input the agent’s epistemic uncertainty (estimated via ensemble dynamics models; Chua et al., 2018) and temporal difference (TD) error.
- The gate outputs weights for blending model-free policy updates, model-based rollouts, and handcrafted priors (e.g., rigid-body dynamics).
- Inspired by Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures (Shazeer et al., 2017), but with sparsity constraints to avoid computational overhead.
**(2) Hierarchical Priors for Scalability**:
- Implement a library of priors at different abstraction levels (e.g., low-level physics simulators, object-centric transition models).
- Use the gating mechanism to hierarchically combine these priors, enabling the agent to "zoom in" on relevant dynamics (e.g., focus on gripper dynamics during manipulation).
**(3) Stabilized Hybrid Learning**:
- Integrate the above components into an actor-critic framework with a modified Bellman backup:
- Model-based rollouts generate synthetic data only for state-action pairs where the dynamics model’s uncertainty is below a learned threshold.
- Model-free updates dominate when the critic’s TD error is high, indicating model inaccuracy.
- Address distributional shift via conservative policy updates (similar to CQL; Kumar et al., 2020).
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Validate Gating Mechanism in Toy Environments**:
- Test on grid-world tasks with sparse rewards (e.g., Key-Door; Chevalier-Boisvert et al., 2018).
- Metrics: Sample efficiency (steps to solve), gate activation patterns (e.g., does it favor model-based rollouts early?).
2. **Benchmark Against MBRL Baselines**:
- Compare to MBPO, Dreamer (Hafner et al., 2020), and PPO on MuJoCo locomotion (Hopper, Walker2D).
- Ablate gating components to isolate contributions.
3. **Sparse-Robot Manipulation**:
- Evaluate on MetaWorld (Yu et al., 2020) tasks with <1% reward density.
- Measure success rate vs. interaction steps, with human-designed priors (e.g., grasp stability models).
4. **Generalization to Novel Tasks**:
- Train on a suite of tasks (e.g., Procgen; Cobbe et al., 2020) and test zero-shot on unseen variants.
- Analyze gate behavior to test if it generalizes priors across tasks.
5. **Real-World Robot Validation**:
- Deploy on a Franka Emika arm for peg-in-hole and drawer-opening tasks.
- Quantify real-world sample efficiency vs. sim-to-baselines like RAD (Laskin et al., 2020).

1. Title:
**Efficient Reinforcement Learning with Adaptive Model-Based Priors**
2. Problem Statement:
Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in domains like games and robotics, but its sample inefficiency remains a critical bottleneck, particularly in real-world applications where data collection is expensive or risky. Model-free RL methods often require millions of interactions to converge, while model-based RL (MBRL) can improve sample efficiency but suffers from compounding errors in learned dynamics models. Current hybrid approaches, such as Dyna-style algorithms or latent-space models, struggle to balance the trade-off between computational overhead and generalization to novel states. There is a pressing need for RL methods that can leverage learned models adaptively—only when they provide reliable predictions—without sacrificing the robustness of model-free learning.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the key limitation of existing MBRL methods is their rigid reliance on learned models, even when those models are inaccurate. Prior work (e.g., Nagabandi et al., 2018; Janner et al., 2019) shows that model errors can degrade performance, but heuristic solutions like early termination or uncertainty thresholds are brittle. Our central idea is that RL agents should dynamically adjust their trust in model-based predictions based on both epistemic (model uncertainty) and aleatoric (environment stochasticity) factors.
We propose that an adaptive gating mechanism—trained jointly with the model-free policy—can selectively blend model-based and model-free updates. This approach could retain the sample efficiency of MBRL while mitigating its instability, particularly in sparse-reward or long-horizon tasks.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a framework called **Adaptive Model-Based Priors (AMBP)**, which consists of three key innovations:
(1) **Uncertainty-Aware Dynamics Gating**:
We will design a gating function that evaluates the reliability of model-based rollouts in real time. This function will use ensemble-based uncertainty estimates (Chua et al., 2018) and latent-space consistency metrics (Hafner et al., 2020) to compute a blending weight between model-based and model-free value targets. The gating mechanism will be trained end-to-end using a meta-reinforcement learning objective to maximize long-term returns.
(2) **Efficient Hybrid Learning**:
To avoid the computational cost of full model rollouts, we will develop a truncated rollout strategy where short-horizon model-based trajectories are used to bootstrap the model-free critic. This builds on the success of truncated backpropagation through time (TBPTT) in RL (Ke et al., 2021) but adapts the horizon dynamically based on the gating function’s output.
(3) **Robust Policy Distillation**:
We will integrate a distillation loss (Rusu et al., 2015) to align the model-free policy with the model-based policy’s behavior in high-confidence states. This ensures that the model-free component can recover quickly when the model fails, while still benefiting from the model’s exploratory priors.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Validate Gating Mechanism on Synthetic Tasks**:
- Design a gridworld with stochastic dynamics where model errors are predictable but harmful.
- Compare AMBP’s gating to fixed thresholds (e.g., MBPO; Janner et al., 2019) and purely model-free baselines (SAC, PPO).
- Metrics: Sample efficiency, final performance, and gating accuracy (how often it correctly rejects bad rollouts).
2. **Benchmark on Continuous Control**:
- Test on MuJoCo tasks (e.g., HalfCheetah, Walker) with modified dynamics to simulate real-world distribution shifts.
- Measure robustness to varying levels of injected noise in the dynamics model.
3. **Evaluate on Sparse-Reward Tasks**:
- Use OpenAI Gym’s sparse-reward variants (e.g., AntMaze) to test long-horizon credit assignment.
- Compare exploration efficiency against model-based planners (PETS; Chua et al., 2018) and curiosity-driven methods (Burda et al., 2018).
4. **Scalability to High-Dimensional States**:
- Train on pixel-based tasks (e.g., DeepMind Control Suite) using latent dynamics models (Dreamer; Hafner et al., 2020).
- Ablate the contribution of each AMBP component (gating, distillation, hybrid updates).
5. **Real-World Feasibility Study**:
- Deploy on a physical robot arm for a grasping task with limited data.
- Quantify the reduction in real-world interactions needed to achieve target success rates.

1. Title:
**Efficient Reinforcement Learning with Adaptive Model-Based Priors**
2. Problem Statement:
Model-free reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), have achieved remarkable success in various domains. However, they suffer from high sample inefficiency, often requiring millions of environment interactions to learn effective policies. While model-based RL (MBRL) methods can improve sample efficiency by learning a dynamics model, they often struggle with compounding errors in long-horizon planning and fail to generalize well to unseen states. Current hybrid approaches that combine model-free and model-based RL either rely on fixed model usage or lack principled mechanisms to adaptively balance between model-based and model-free updates. This creates a critical gap in achieving both sample efficiency and robust performance across diverse tasks.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the key limitation of existing hybrid RL methods lies in their inability to dynamically adjust the reliance on model-based priors based on the uncertainty of the learned dynamics model. Prior work (e.g., Nagabandi et al., 2018; Janner et al., 2019) has shown that model-based rollouts can accelerate learning but often degrade performance when the model is inaccurate. We propose that an adaptive mechanism, which dynamically weights model-based and model-free updates based on local model uncertainty, can bridge this gap. Specifically, we hypothesize that:
- **Uncertainty-aware model usage** can prevent over-reliance on inaccurate model predictions, improving robustness.
- **Adaptive blending** of model-based and model-free updates can maximize sample efficiency while avoiding performance degradation due to model bias.
- **Task-aware priors** can further enhance generalization by leveraging model-based knowledge where it is most reliable.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a novel framework, **Adaptive Model-Based Priors (AMBP)**, which integrates uncertainty-aware model usage with adaptive policy optimization. The method consists of three key components:
(1) **Uncertainty-Calibrated Dynamics Model**:
We will train an ensemble of probabilistic neural networks (Chua et al., 2018) to estimate both the dynamics and its epistemic uncertainty. The ensemble disagreement will serve as a proxy for model uncertainty, enabling the agent to identify regions where the model is likely inaccurate.
(2) **Adaptive Policy Optimization**:
We will develop a policy gradient algorithm that dynamically interpolates between model-based and model-free updates. The interpolation weight will be a function of the local model uncertainty, ensuring that the agent relies more on model-free updates in high-uncertainty states. This builds on the theoretical framework of *policy gradient with adaptive baselines* (Tucker et al., 2018).
(3) **Task-Aware Prior Distillation**:
To further improve generalization, we will distill task-agnostic knowledge from the dynamics model into a prior policy (Teh et al., 2017). This prior will be used to regularize the policy updates, ensuring stable learning while retaining the flexibility to adapt to new tasks.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Validate Uncertainty Estimation**:
- Train an ensemble dynamics model on benchmark tasks (MuJoCo, Atari).
- Measure correlation between ensemble disagreement and model error.
- Test if uncertainty thresholds can reliably identify high-error states.
2. **Compare Adaptive vs. Fixed Model Usage**:
- Benchmark AMBP against fixed hybrid methods (e.g., MBPO, STEVE).
- Evaluate sample efficiency (steps to reach 80% of max reward) and final performance.
- Ablate the adaptive weighting mechanism to isolate its contribution.
3. **Test Long-Horizon Generalization**:
- Deploy AMBP on tasks with sparse rewards (e.g., AntMaze, Montezuma’s Revenge).
- Measure success rate and compare to pure model-free and model-based baselines.
4. **Evaluate Transfer Learning**:
- Pretrain AMBP on a suite of related tasks (e.g., varying MuJoCo dynamics).
- Test zero-shot and few-shot adaptation to unseen tasks.
- Analyze whether the prior policy captures reusable skills.
5. **Real-World Feasibility**:
- Deploy AMBP on a physical robot (e.g., robotic arm manipulation).
- Compare data efficiency and robustness to sim-to-real transfer gaps.

Model-free RL methods, while flexible, often require millions of interactions to converge, and model-based RL (MBRL) approaches struggle with compounding errors in long-horizon planning. Recent hybrid methods (e.g., MuZero) combine model-free and model-based learning but still face challenges in dynamically balancing exploration, exploitation, and model trust. There is a pressing need for RL algorithms that can adaptively leverage prior knowledge and learned models to reduce sample complexity without sacrificing asymptotic performance.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the key to improving RL efficiency lies in **adaptive model-based priors**—dynamically weighting the influence of learned models and prior knowledge based on their uncertainty and task relevance. Current methods either rigidly rely on models (e.g., Dyna) or discard them entirely during policy optimization (e.g., PPO). We propose that an RL agent can achieve better sample efficiency by:
(1) **Learning uncertainty-aware dynamics models** that quantify epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty, and
(2) **Adaptively blending model-based and model-free updates** based on the reliability of the model for specific state-action regions.
This approach could bridge the gap between the robustness of model-free methods and the efficiency of model-based methods, particularly in sparse-reward or long-horizon tasks.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a framework called **Adaptive Prior RL (APRL)** with three technical components:
**(1) Uncertainty-Calibrated Dynamics Models**:
We will extend probabilistic ensemble models (Chua et al., 2018) with latent uncertainty representations, using Bayesian neural networks to partition uncertainty into epistemic (reducible with data) and aleatoric (inherent noise) components. The model will be trained via maximum likelihood with regularization to prevent overconfidence.
**(2) Adaptive Prior Weighting**:
We will derive a weighting function that dynamically adjusts the contribution of model-based rollouts versus model-free policy updates. The weight will depend on the model’s uncertainty estimates and the empirical Bellman error of the current policy. This builds on the idea of *model-value expansion* (Buckman et al., 2018) but with a learned, context-dependent weighting mechanism.
**(3) Hybrid Policy Optimization**:
We will integrate the above components into a policy gradient framework (e.g., SAC or PPO) where the agent can selectively use model-based rollouts for exploration and model-free updates for fine-tuning. The policy will be trained with a multi-objective loss combining model-based value targets and model-free advantage estimates, weighted by the adaptive prior.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Validate Uncertainty Estimation**:
- Train ensemble dynamics models on benchmark tasks (MuJoCo, Atari) and measure their uncertainty calibration (e.g., via expected calibration error).
- Test if the model can detect out-of-distribution states in procedurally generated environments (e.g., OpenAI Procgen).
2. **Benchmark Adaptive Weighting**:
- Compare APRL against fixed-weight hybrids (e.g., MBPO) on sparse-reward tasks (e.g., AntMaze).
- Measure how often the agent switches between model-based and model-free updates during training.
3. **Evaluate Long-Horizon Performance**:
- Test APRL on tasks requiring multi-step reasoning (e.g., Montezuma’s Revenge, robotic manipulation with sparse rewards).
- Track the compounding error of model-based rollouts versus empirical returns.
4. **Ablation Studies**:
- Disable uncertainty estimation or adaptive weighting to isolate their contributions.
- Vary the ensemble size and prior strength to study trade-offs between compute and sample efficiency.
5. **Real-World Feasibility**:
- Deploy APRL on a physical robot (e.g., UR5 arm) for a grasping task with limited data.

**Efficient Reinforcement Learning with Adaptive Model-Based Priors**
2. Problem Statement:
Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in domains like game playing and robotics, but its sample inefficiency remains a critical bottleneck. Model-free RL methods often require millions of interactions to learn effective policies, making them impractical for real-world applications where data collection is expensive or time-consuming. While model-based RL (MBRL) can improve sample efficiency by leveraging learned dynamics models, these methods often suffer from compounding errors in long-horizon planning and struggle with partial observability or non-stationary environments. Existing approaches either rely on fixed, hand-designed priors (e.g., Gaussian dynamics) or overly simplistic world models, limiting their adaptability to complex tasks. There is a need for a framework that dynamically balances exploration, exploitation, and model uncertainty while efficiently integrating prior knowledge.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the key to bridging the sample-efficiency gap lies in *adaptive model-based priors*—learned dynamics models that can dynamically adjust their uncertainty estimates and inductive biases based on the current state and task requirements. Prior work has shown that probabilistic ensembles (Chua et al., 2018) and meta-learning (Nagabandi et al., 2018) can improve MBRL robustness, but these methods lack mechanisms to actively modulate their priors during deployment. We propose that by integrating *hierarchical latent representations* with *uncertainty-aware planning*, an RL agent can:
- Adaptively simplify or refine its world model based on task complexity,
- Allocate computation to uncertain states while leveraging cached knowledge for predictable regions, and
- Generalize across tasks by learning reusable priors from limited interaction data.
4. Proposed Method:
Our approach combines three innovations:
(1) **Hierarchical Latent Dynamics**: We will design a variational autoencoder (VAE)-based dynamics model with two levels of abstraction:
- A *global latent space* capturing slow-changing task structure (e.g., environment physics), trained via contrastive learning to disentangle invariant factors.
- A *local latent space* encoding fast-varying state transitions, optimized for short-horizon prediction accuracy. This builds on recent advances in hierarchical RL (Hafner et al., 2022) but adds explicit uncertainty quantification.
(2) **Uncertainty-Driven Planning**: We will extend Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to dynamically adjust its search depth and branching factor based on the model’s epistemic uncertainty. Inspired by Silver et al. (2017), we will use upper confidence bounds (UCB) to balance exploration of high-uncertainty states with exploitation of known high-reward paths. Crucially, we will introduce a *computational budget* mechanism to terminate planning early in predictable states.
(3) **Meta-Learned Priors**: To enable fast adaptation, we will pretrain the dynamics model on a distribution of related tasks using Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) (Finn et al., 2017). The model will learn to rapidly adjust its latent representations given small amounts of new task data, reducing the need for exhaustive retraining.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Validate Hierarchical Dynamics**:
- *Toy Environments*: Test the VAE’s ability to disentangle global vs. local factors in grid-worlds with moving obstacles.
- *Benchmark Comparison*: Compare prediction accuracy to vanilla MBRL (e.g., PETS; Chua et al., 2018) on MuJoCo locomotion tasks.
2. **Evaluate Uncertainty-Aware Planning**:
- *Sparse-Reward Navigation*: Measure sample efficiency in AntMaze (Fu et al., 2020), where long-horizon planning is critical.
- *Non-Stationary Tasks*: Introduce sudden dynamics shifts (e.g., friction changes) and track recovery speed.
3. **Test Meta-Learning**:
- *Multi-Task Adaptation*: Train on a suite of robot manipulation tasks (MetaWorld; Yu et al., 2020) and evaluate few-shot adaptation to unseen objects.
4. **Ablation Studies**:
- Disable hierarchical latents or uncertainty modulation to isolate their contributions.
- Vary the computational budget to analyze trade-offs between planning depth and real-time decision speed.
5. **Real-World Validation**:
- Deploy on a physical robot arm for peg-in-hole tasks, comparing data efficiency to model-free PPO (Schulman et al., 2017).

There is a pressing need for a framework that dynamically adapts the reliance on model-based priors to maximize sample efficiency without sacrificing asymptotic performance.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the key limitation of existing MBRL methods lies in their static use of learned models, which either over-rely on imperfect models (leading to bias) or underutilize them (wasting sample efficiency). Recent work by Janner et al. (2019) demonstrated that model-based value expansion can improve policy optimization, but their approach assumes a fixed rollout horizon. Meanwhile, Kurutach et al. (2018) showed that ensemble models can mitigate model bias but do not adaptively adjust their influence during training.
Our central hypothesis is that an RL agent can achieve superior sample efficiency by dynamically modulating its trust in model-based predictions based on the estimated uncertainty of the learned model. Specifically, we propose that an adaptive mechanism—which scales the contribution of model-based rollouts during policy updates—can bridge the gap between sample efficiency and asymptotic performance.

(2018), we will extend their approach to estimate both epistemic (model) and aleatoric (environment) uncertainty. The model will generate rollouts only in state-action regions where its predictions are confident, avoiding compounding errors in uncertain regions.
(2) **Dynamic Horizon Adaptation**: Inspired by the theoretical analysis of Luo et al. (2021), we will develop a mechanism to automatically adjust the rollout horizon during policy optimization. Instead of a fixed horizon, the agent will use a learned function that maps model uncertainty to rollout length, enabling longer rollouts in predictable states and shorter (or zero) rollouts in uncertain ones.
(3) **Policy Optimization with Adaptive Blending**: We will integrate the above components into a policy gradient framework, where the agent interpolates between model-free and model-based updates. The blending weights will be conditioned on the estimated model uncertainty, ensuring that the agent gradually shifts toward model-free learning as the policy converges.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Validate Uncertainty Estimation**:
• Train an ensemble dynamics model on benchmark tasks (e.g., MuJoCo locomotion) and quantify its uncertainty calibration.
• Compare against baselines (e.g., PETS, MBPO) to verify that our uncertainty estimates better correlate with prediction errors.
2. **Test Dynamic Horizon Adaptation**:
• Design synthetic tasks with varying levels of stochasticity (e.g., modified HalfCheetah with randomized dynamics).
• Measure whether our adaptive horizon mechanism correctly reduces rollout length in high-uncertainty regions.
3. **Benchmark Sample Efficiency**:
• Compare AMBP against state-of-the-art hybrid methods (MBPO, Dreamer) on continuous control tasks (Hopper, Walker2D).
• Evaluate performance at low data regimes (10k–100k steps) and asymptotic regimes (1M+ steps).
4. **Ablation Studies**:
• Disable uncertainty estimation or dynamic blending to isolate their contributions.
• Vary ensemble size and measure its impact on uncertainty calibration and final performance.
5. **Real-World Feasibility**:
• Deploy AMBP on a physical robotic arm task (e.g., peg-in-hole) to assess its practicality in noisy, real-world settings.
• Measure sample efficiency compared to pure model-free (PPO) and model-based (PETS) baselines.

**Efficient Reinforcement Learning with Adaptive Model-Based Priors**
2. Problem Statement:
Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in domains like games and robotics, but its sample inefficiency remains a critical limitation. Model-free RL methods often require millions of interactions to learn effective policies, making them impractical for real-world applications with costly or limited data (Haarnoja et al., 2018). While model-based RL (MBRL) can improve sample efficiency by learning a dynamics model, these methods struggle with compounding errors in long-horizon planning and often fail to outperform model-free baselines (Janner et al., 2019). Existing hybrid approaches, such as Dyna-style algorithms or uncertainty-aware MBRL, either rely on heuristic planning or suffer from computational overhead, leaving a gap in scalable, adaptive methods that balance exploration and exploitation.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the key to bridging this gap lies in dynamically integrating model-based priors into model-free RL, enabling adaptive trade-offs between sample efficiency and asymptotic performance. Prior work has shown that fixed model-based priors can accelerate learning but may limit final performance due to model bias (Schrittwieser et al., 2020). Our central idea is to develop a *learned adaptive prior* that adjusts its influence based on the estimated reliability of the dynamics model. We posit that this approach will:
- Reduce sample complexity by leveraging model-based rollouts when the model is accurate.
- Mitigate compounding errors by decaying the prior’s influence as uncertainty grows.
- Enable scalable deployment by avoiding costly ensemble-based uncertainty estimation (Pathak et al., 2019).
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a three-part framework, **Adaptive Prior RL (APRL)**:
(1) **Uncertainty-Aware Dynamics Learning**: Instead of ensembles, we will train a single dynamics model with a latent uncertainty head, inspired by Bayesian neural networks (BNNs). The model will output both predicted next states and epistemic uncertainty estimates, computed via Monte Carlo dropout (Gal & Ghahramani, 2016). This avoids the computational cost of ensembles while preserving uncertainty quantification.
(2) **Adaptive Prior Weighting**: We will derive a closed-form weighting scheme for the model-based prior, dynamically adjusting its contribution to the policy gradient based on the uncertainty estimates. The weight will follow a sigmoid function of the model’s uncertainty, ensuring smooth transitions between model-based and model-free updates.
(3) **Stabilized Rollouts**: To mitigate compounding errors, we will employ short-horizon model rollouts (e.g., 1–5 steps) and use the uncertainty estimates to terminate rollouts early when predictions become unreliable. This balances the benefits of planning with the robustness of model-free learning.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Validate Uncertainty Estimation**:
- Compare our dropout-based uncertainty to ensemble methods on benchmark tasks (e.g., MuJoCo).
- Measure calibration error and runtime to demonstrate efficiency gains.
2. **Benchmark Sample Efficiency**:
- Train APRL on continuous control tasks (Hopper, Walker2D) and compare to SAC (Haarnoja et al., 2018) and MBPO (Janner et al., 2019).
- Metrics: Episode return vs. environment steps, wall-clock time.
3. **Test Long-Horizon Generalization**:
- Evaluate on tasks with sparse rewards (e.g., Ant Maze) to assess robustness to compounding errors.

1. Title:
**Efficient Reinforcement Learning with Adaptive Model-Based Priors**
2. Problem Statement:
Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in domains like game playing and robotics, but its sample inefficiency remains a critical limitation. Model-free RL methods, while flexible, often require millions of interactions to converge, making them impractical for real-world applications where data collection is expensive or risky. Model-based RL (MBRL) offers better sample efficiency by leveraging learned dynamics models, but these methods struggle with compounding errors in long-horizon planning and often fail to outperform model-free baselines. Current hybrid approaches, such as Dyna-style algorithms or uncertainty-aware planning, either lack robustness or introduce significant computational overhead. There is a pressing need for a framework that combines the sample efficiency of model-based methods with the asymptotic performance of model-free RL while maintaining computational tractability.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the key limitation of existing MBRL methods lies in their static use of learned models. Typically, these models are trained once and then used for planning without adaptation, even as the agent’s policy evolves and explores new regions of the state space. This rigidity leads to poor generalization and compounding errors.
Our central idea is to introduce *adaptive model-based priors*—dynamically updated models that are conditioned on the agent’s current policy and uncertainty estimates. We posit that by (1) selectively leveraging model-based predictions in regions of high confidence and (2) continuously refining the model’s focus based on the agent’s exploration progress, we can achieve significant improvements in sample efficiency without sacrificing asymptotic performance. This approach draws inspiration from Bayesian reinforcement learning (Ghavamzadeh et al., 2015) and recent advances in meta-learning for dynamics models (Nagabandi et al., 2020), but with a novel emphasis on adaptive model-policy co-adaptation.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a three-part framework to address these challenges:
(1) **Uncertainty-Aware Model Adaptation**:
We will develop a dynamics model that explicitly quantifies epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty, building on probabilistic ensembles (Chua et al., 2018). The model will be updated online using a prioritized replay mechanism, where data from under-explored states or high-prediction-error regions are given higher weight. This ensures the model adapts to the agent’s current policy and exploration focus.
(2) **Policy-Guided Model Usage**:
Instead of using the model uniformly for planning, we will introduce a gating mechanism that selectively activates model-based rollouts based on the model’s uncertainty and the agent’s learning progress. This builds on the idea of "model-value expansion" (Buckman et al., 2018) but extends it to dynamically adjust the horizon of model-based rollouts. The gating mechanism will be trained via meta-gradient descent to optimize the trade-off between sample efficiency and policy performance.
(3) **Efficient Planning with Adaptive Trees**:
To mitigate computational overhead, we will design a sparse planning algorithm that expands Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) nodes only in high-uncertainty or high-value regions, as predicted by the agent’s value function. This approach combines the strengths of MCTS (Silver et al., 2016) with modern RL value estimators, reducing the branching factor while preserving long-horizon reasoning.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Validate Model Adaptation on Toy Domains**:
- Test the uncertainty-aware model on grid-world and pendulum tasks, measuring its ability to reduce compounding errors compared to fixed models.
- Ablate the prioritized replay mechanism to isolate its contribution to sample efficiency.
2. **Benchmark Hybrid Performance on MuJoCo**:
- Compare our method to state-of-the-art model-free (SAC, PPO) and model-based (PETS, Dreamer) baselines on continuous control tasks (Hopper, Walker, Humanoid).
- Metrics: Sample efficiency (steps to reach 80% of max reward), asymptotic performance (final reward), and computational cost (wall-clock time).
3. **Evaluate Long-Horizon Generalization**:
- Deploy the method on tasks with sparse rewards and long horizons (e.g., Ant Maze, Fetch Pick-and-Place).
- Measure the agent’s ability to leverage adaptive rollouts for exploration, using success rate and path-length optimality as metrics.
4. **Test Real-World Robustness**:
- Collaborate with robotics labs to validate the method on a physical robot arm (sim-to-real transfer).
- Focus on tasks where data collection is expensive (e.g., delicate object manipulation).
5. **Ablation and Scaling Studies**:
- Ablate components (gating mechanism, uncertainty quantification) to identify critical factors.
- Scale to high-dimensional environments (e.g., Atari games) to test generalization beyond low-dimensional control.

1. Title:
**Efficient Reinforcement Learning with Adaptive Credit Assignment and Sparse Rewards**
2. Problem Statement:
Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in domains with dense rewards, such as games and robotics (Silver et al., 2018). However, in real-world scenarios where rewards are sparse or delayed, RL algorithms struggle due to inefficient credit assignment and exploration bottlenecks (Arulkumaran et al., 2019). Existing methods, such as hierarchical RL (Nachum et al., 2019) or intrinsic motivation (Pathak et al., 2017), partially address these issues but often introduce additional complexity or fail to generalize across tasks. There is a critical need for RL algorithms that can efficiently learn from sparse rewards while maintaining sample efficiency and scalability.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the inefficiency of RL in sparse-reward settings stems from two key limitations: (1) uniform credit assignment, which fails to distinguish between critical and trivial actions, and (2) exploration strategies that do not adapt to the task structure. Recent work by Hung et al. (2019) shows that adaptive exploration can improve sample efficiency, but their approach does not explicitly address credit assignment.
Our central idea is to integrate **adaptive credit assignment** with **structured exploration** to bridge this gap. We propose that dynamically reweighting the contribution of past actions to observed rewards (credit assignment) and leveraging task-specific exploration heuristics (e.g., novelty detection or goal-conditioned policies) can significantly improve RL performance in sparse-reward environments.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a three-part framework to address these challenges:
(1) **Adaptive Credit Assignment via Retrospective Analysis**:
We will design a mechanism to retrospectively analyze trajectories and reweight the importance of past actions based on their estimated contribution to future rewards. This builds on the idea of "return decomposition" (Arjona-Medina et al., 2019) but extends it to non-stationary environments by using a learned attention mechanism over trajectory segments.
(2) **Structured Exploration with Task-Conditioned Intrinsic Rewards**:
Instead of relying on generic curiosity-driven exploration, we will derive intrinsic rewards conditioned on task-specific features (e.g., state visitation counts or goal proximity). This approach combines ideas from goal-conditioned RL (Schaul et al., 2015) and count-based exploration (Bellemare et al., 2016) but adapts them dynamically using meta-learning.
(3) **Unified Architecture for Scalable Training**:
We will integrate these components into a single architecture that jointly optimizes policy, credit assignment, and exploration. The design will leverage transformer-based memory (Parisotto et al., 2020) to handle long-term dependencies and enable efficient parallel training.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Validate Credit Assignment Mechanism**:
- Synthetic tasks with delayed rewards (e.g., "key-door" environments) to test if our method correctly identifies critical actions.
- Compare against baseline methods (e.g., Proximal Policy Optimization (Schulman et al., 2017) and Monte Carlo returns).
2. **Evaluate Exploration Strategies**:
- Benchmark on sparse-reward tasks (e.g., AntMaze (Fu et al., 2020)) to measure exploration efficiency.
- Ablate intrinsic reward components to isolate their contributions.
3. **Test Generalization to Complex Tasks**:
- Scale to high-dimensional environments (e.g., robotic manipulation with RGB observations).
- Measure zero-shot transfer performance to unseen task variants.
4. **Quantify Sample Efficiency**:
- Compare training curves against state-of-the-art baselines (e.g., R2D2 (Kapturowski et al., 2019) and DreamerV3 (Hafner et al., 2023)).
- Profile computational overhead of our method.
5. **Ablation Studies**:
- Analyze the impact of credit assignment window size.
- Test alternative exploration heuristics (e.g., entropy maximization vs. novelty detection).

Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in domains like games and robotics, but its sample inefficiency remains a critical bottleneck, particularly in real-world applications where data collection is expensive or risky. Model-free RL methods often require millions of interactions to converge, while model-based RL (MBRL) can improve sample efficiency but suffers from compounding errors in learned dynamics models. Current hybrid approaches, such as Dyna-style algorithms or probabilistic ensembles, still struggle to balance exploration, exploitation, and model bias. There is a pressing need for a framework that dynamically adapts the reliance on model-based priors to maximize sample efficiency without sacrificing asymptotic performance.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the key limitation of existing MBRL methods is their static use of learned models, which either over-rely on imperfect models (leading to suboptimal policies) or underutilize them (wasting informative priors). Recent work by Janner et al. (2019) shows that model-based value expansion can improve policy optimization, but their approach assumes a fixed rollout horizon. Meanwhile, Kurutach et al. (2018) demonstrate that ensemble models can mitigate model bias but do not adaptively weight model trust during training.
Our central idea is to introduce *adaptive model-based priors* (AMPs), where the RL agent dynamically adjusts its reliance on model-generated data based on uncertainty estimates and policy learning progress. We posit that this approach will:
1) Reduce sample complexity by leveraging model predictions when they are trustworthy,
2) Prevent model bias by falling back to model-free updates when uncertainty is high, and
3) Automatically interpolate between these regimes via a learned meta-controller.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose to develop AMP-RL, a framework with three key innovations:
(1) **Uncertainty-Aware Model Rollouts**:
We will extend probabilistic ensemble dynamics models (Chua et al., 2018) with epistemic uncertainty quantification. Instead of fixed-length rollouts, the agent will use a dropout-based uncertainty metric (Gal & Ghahramani, 2016) to terminate rollouts early when predictions become unreliable. This avoids compounding errors while maximizing usable model-generated data.
(2) **Adaptive Policy Optimization**:
We will integrate model-generated transitions into proximal policy optimization (PPO) (Schulman et al., 2017) but dynamically reweight their contribution to the policy gradient based on uncertainty. A small neural network will learn to predict the optimal weighting by correlating past model errors with policy performance degradation.
(3) **Meta-Learning the Trade-off**:
Inspired by MAML (Finn et al., 2017), we will meta-train the uncertainty threshold and rollout horizon parameters across diverse tasks. The goal is to learn generalizable rules for when to trust the model, enabling fast adaptation to new environments.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Validate Uncertainty Estimation**:
- Train ensemble dynamics models on MuJoCo benchmarks (Hopper, Walker2D).
- Measure correlation between model uncertainty and true prediction error.
- Test if early termination based on uncertainty reduces rollout bias.
2. **Benchmark Sample Efficiency**:
- Compare AMP-RL against SAC (Haarnoja et al., 2018) and MBRL baselines (PETS, SLBO) on DMControl tasks.
- Metrics: Episode reward vs. environment steps, wall-clock time.
- Ablate adaptive weighting to isolate its contribution.
3. **Test Robustness to Model Misspecification**:
- Introduce systematic perturbations to physics parameters (e.g., mass, friction).
- Evaluate whether AMP-RL recovers faster than pure MBRL or model-free methods.
4. **Meta-Learning Generalization**:
- Train on a distribution of 50 procedurally generated robotics tasks.
- Test zero-shot adaptation to unseen tasks (e.g., new robot morphologies).
5. **Real-World Validation**:
- Deploy on a physical robot arm for peg-in-hole tasks.

Current hybrid approaches, such as Dyna-style algorithms or probabilistic ensembles, partially address these issues but still struggle with scalability and generalization across diverse tasks. There is a pressing need for RL methods that can leverage prior knowledge adaptively, reducing sample complexity without sacrificing asymptotic performance.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the key limitation of existing MBRL methods is their rigid reliance on either learned dynamics or fixed priors, which fail to adapt to the uncertainty and structure of the environment. For instance, fixed Gaussian priors in probabilistic MBRL (e.g., PETS [1]) may underfit complex dynamics, while purely learned models (e.g., Dreamer [2]) can overfit to limited data.
Our central idea is to introduce *adaptive model-based priors* (AMPs), which dynamically adjust the influence of prior knowledge based on the current state and task uncertainty. We posit that by integrating meta-learning with hierarchical Bayesian inference, AMPs can:
- Reduce sample complexity by leveraging priors in low-data regimes,
- Mitigate compounding errors by downweighting unreliable predictions, and
- Generalize across tasks by learning to adapt priors from past experience.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a three-part framework:
(1) **Hierarchical Bayesian Dynamics Models**:
We will extend probabilistic ensemble dynamics models (e.g., PETS [1]) with a hierarchical prior structure. The base layer will use a Gaussian process (GP) or neural process prior, while the meta-layer will learn to modulate the prior’s strength via a hypernetwork. This allows the model to interpolate between learned dynamics and prior knowledge based on uncertainty estimates.
(2) **Uncertainty-Aware Policy Optimization**:
We will develop a policy gradient variant that explicitly accounts for model uncertainty. Inspired by Bayesian RL [3], our policy will optimize a lower bound on expected return weighted by the confidence of the dynamics model. This avoids over-reliance on inaccurate predictions while retaining the benefits of planning.
(3) **Meta-Learning Priors Across Tasks**:
To enable cross-task generalization, we will train the prior adaptation mechanism using meta-RL (e.g., PEARL [4]). The hypernetwork will learn to generate task-specific priors from a small number of trajectories, allowing rapid adaptation to novel environments.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Validate AMPs on Synthetic Benchmarks**:
- Design toy environments where fixed priors fail (e.g., non-stationary dynamics).
- Compare AMPs to baselines (PETS, Dreamer) on sample efficiency and final performance.
2. **Benchmark on Continuous Control Tasks**:
- Test on MuJoCo (e.g., HalfCheetah, Walker) with limited data (≤100k steps).
- Measure robustness to model mismatch by perturbing dynamics post-training.

- Use Meta-World [5] to assess few-shot adaptation.
- Ablate the meta-learning component to isolate its contribution.
4. **Scale to High-Dimensional Observations**:

**Efficient Reinforcement Learning with Adaptive Model-Based Priors**
2. Problem Statement:
Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in domains like games and robotics, but its sample inefficiency remains a critical limitation. Model-free RL methods, while flexible, often require millions of interactions to learn effective policies, making them impractical for real-world applications with costly or limited data. Model-based RL (MBRL) offers better sample efficiency by learning a dynamics model, but its performance is highly sensitive to model bias and inaccuracies, especially in high-dimensional or partially observable environments. Current hybrid approaches, such as Dyna-style algorithms or latent-space models, struggle to balance the trade-off between model exploitation and exploration, often leading to suboptimal policies or catastrophic failures due to compounding errors.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the key to bridging the sample efficiency gap lies in dynamically adapting the reliance on model-based priors during learning. Existing methods either rigidly alternate between model-free and model-based updates or use fixed weighting schemes, which fail to account for the varying uncertainty and reliability of the learned model across different state-action regions.
Our central idea is to introduce an *adaptive trust mechanism* that automatically adjusts the influence of model-based predictions based on their local accuracy and uncertainty. We believe that by (1) quantifying model uncertainty in a principled way and (2) using this uncertainty to guide policy updates and exploration, we can achieve more robust and sample-efficient learning. Specifically, we predict that dynamically reweighting model-based targets—downweighting unreliable predictions and upweighting high-confidence ones—will outperform static hybrid approaches while maintaining the stability of pure model-free methods.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a novel framework, **Adaptive Model-Based Priors (AMBP)**, which integrates three key innovations:
(1) **Uncertainty-Aware Dynamics Modeling**:
We will extend probabilistic ensemble dynamics models (Chua et al., 2018) with epistemic uncertainty quantification via Bayesian neural networks or dropout ensembles. Unlike prior work, we will explicitly model *local* uncertainty (per state-action pair) rather than global averages, enabling finer-grained adaptation.
(2) **Adaptive Trust Mechanism**:
The core of AMBP is a gating function that dynamically adjusts the weight of model-based targets in the policy update. This function will be learned jointly with the policy, using a meta-learning objective to maximize long-term returns while penalizing over-reliance on inaccurate model predictions. The mechanism will be inspired by *attention-based* weighting (Vaswani et al., 2017) but applied to model-policy interactions.
(3) **Directed Exploration with Model Uncertainty**:
We will use model uncertainty to guide exploration, biasing the policy toward under-modeled regions of the state-action space. Unlike optimism-driven exploration (e.g., UCB), our approach will explicitly decouple exploration bonuses from the policy’s trust in the model, avoiding premature convergence to biased solutions.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Validate Uncertainty Quantification**:
- Train ensemble dynamics models on benchmark tasks (MuJoCo, Atari) and measure correlation between predicted uncertainty and actual prediction error.
- Compare Bayesian neural networks vs. dropout ensembles for local uncertainty estimation.
2. **Benchmark Adaptive Trust Mechanism**:
- Compare AMBP against fixed-ratio hybrids (e.g., STEVE, MBPO) on sparse-reward tasks (e.g., AntMaze).
- Ablate the gating function to isolate its contribution to sample efficiency.
3. **Test Scalability to High-Dimensional Spaces**:
- Evaluate AMBP on pixel-based tasks (DeepMind Control Suite) using latent-space dynamics models.
- Measure how model trust adapts across different phases of learning (e.g., early exploration vs. late refinement).

**Efficient Reinforcement Learning via Adaptive Model-Based Value Estimation**
2. Problem Statement:
Model-free reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), have achieved remarkable success in various domains. However, they suffer from high sample complexity due to their reliance on trial-and-error interactions with the environment. Model-based RL (MBRL) methods aim to mitigate this by learning a dynamics model to reduce real-world interactions, but they often struggle with compounding errors in long-horizon predictions and fail to outperform model-free baselines in complex tasks. Recent hybrid approaches, such as MuZero, combine model-free value estimation with learned dynamics but are computationally expensive and require careful tuning. There remains a critical gap in developing RL methods that are both sample-efficient and computationally tractable while maintaining robustness to model inaccuracies.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the key limitation of current MBRL methods lies in their rigid separation of model learning and value estimation. Existing approaches either use the learned model for planning (e.g., Monte Carlo Tree Search) or as a data augmentation tool (e.g., Dyna-style methods), but they do not dynamically adapt the role of the model based on its local accuracy or the task’s uncertainty. We propose that an *adaptive* integration of model-based and model-free value estimation can bridge this gap. Specifically, we hypothesize that:
- **Dynamic Model Trust**: The RL agent should weigh model-based predictions more heavily in state-action regions where the model is accurate and fall back to model-free estimates in uncertain regions.
- **Error-Aware Planning**: By propagating uncertainty estimates through the model’s rollouts, the agent can avoid over-reliance on erroneous long-horizon predictions.
- **Unified Learning**: Jointly optimizing the dynamics model, value function, and policy under a shared objective will reduce conflicts between components and improve stability.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose **Adaptive Model-Based Value Estimation (AMVE)**, a hybrid RL framework that dynamically interpolates between model-based and model-free value estimates. The method consists of three key innovations:
(1) **Uncertainty-Guided Model Trust**: We introduce a learned uncertainty metric for the dynamics model, derived from ensemble disagreement or Bayesian neural networks. This metric will gate the blending of model-based and model-free targets in the Bellman update. For example, in low-uncertainty states, the agent will rely more on model-based rollouts; in high-uncertainty states, it will default to model-free Q-values.
(2) **Error-Propagating Value Targets**: To address compounding model errors, we will develop a modified Bellman backup that discounts model-based rollouts by their accumulated uncertainty. This builds on ideas from conservative policy iteration but extends them to continuous action spaces and stochastic environments.
(3) **Joint Optimization via Bi-Level Objective**: We will formulate a unified objective where the dynamics model is trained not only to minimize prediction error but also to maximize the usefulness of its rollouts for value estimation. This aligns the model’s learning with the RL task’s end goal, avoiding the "model bias" problem where accurate dynamics do not translate to better policies.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Validate Adaptive Blending on Synthetic Tasks**:
- Design toy MDPs with known model inaccuracies (e.g., partially observable regions or non-stationary dynamics).
- Compare AMVE’s blending mechanism to fixed-ratio hybrids (e.g., 50% model-free + 50% model-based) and pure model-free/model-based baselines.
- Metrics: Sample efficiency, final policy performance, and robustness to model error.
2. **Benchmark on Continuous Control**:
- Test AMVE on MuJoCo tasks (e.g., Hopper, Walker2D) against SAC, MBRL (PETS), and hybrid baselines (MuZero).
- Ablate the uncertainty propagation component to isolate its contribution.
3. **Long-Horizon Task Evaluation**:
- Evaluate on tasks requiring multi-step reasoning, such as AntMaze or FetchPush, where model error compounding is severe.
- Measure the agent’s ability to recover from model mistakes via fallback to model-free estimates.

**Efficient Exploration in Reinforcement Learning via Latent World Models with Uncertainty-Aware Intrinsic Rewards**
2. Problem Statement:
Reinforcement learning (RL) agents often struggle with efficient exploration in environments with sparse or delayed rewards. While model-free RL methods like PPO and SAC have achieved success in dense-reward settings, their sample inefficiency and poor exploration capabilities limit their applicability to real-world problems where rewards are rare or costly to obtain. Existing exploration strategies, such as count-based methods (e.g., Bellemare et al., 2016) or curiosity-driven intrinsic rewards (Pathak et al., 2017), often fail to scale to high-dimensional state spaces or suffer from "noisy TV" problems (distraction by stochastic dynamics). There is a critical need for exploration methods that can systematically disentangle epistemic (learnable) from aleatoric (inherent) uncertainty to guide exploration effectively.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the key limitation of current exploration methods is their inability to distinguish between *learnable* uncertainty (epistemic) and *inherent* uncertainty (aleatoric) in the environment dynamics. This leads to inefficient exploration, as agents waste effort on irreducible noise or stochastic transitions. Our central idea is to integrate a latent world model with uncertainty quantification to derive intrinsic rewards that explicitly target epistemic uncertainty. By learning a compact latent representation of the environment dynamics and using Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) or ensemble methods to estimate uncertainty, we can guide the agent to explore states where the model’s predictions are unreliable but improvable.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a three-part framework to address this challenge:
(1) **Latent World Model with Uncertainty Quantification**:
We will train a variational autoencoder (VAE) or contrastive latent model (e.g., Hafner et al., 2020) to compress high-dimensional observations into a low-dimensional latent space. The dynamics model will be implemented as a BNN or ensemble of neural networks (Osband et al., 2018) to estimate epistemic uncertainty. The key innovation is to use the disagreement among ensemble members or the variance of the BNN posterior as a measure of epistemic uncertainty.
(2) **Uncertainty-Aware Intrinsic Reward**:
We will design an intrinsic reward function that scales inversely with the agent’s confidence in its predictions. Specifically, the reward will be proportional to the epistemic uncertainty of the latent dynamics model, encouraging the agent to explore regions where the model is uncertain but can improve. To avoid the "noisy TV" problem, we will mask out aleatoric uncertainty by comparing the model’s uncertainty on *predicted* states versus *observed* states.
(3) **Hybrid Exploration Policy**:
We will combine the uncertainty-driven intrinsic reward with a model-free RL algorithm (e.g., SAC or PPO) to balance exploration and exploitation. The policy will be trained on a weighted sum of extrinsic (task) rewards and intrinsic (uncertainty) rewards, with an adaptive weighting scheme to phase out intrinsic rewards as the model’s uncertainty decreases.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Validate Uncertainty Estimation**:
- Train the latent world model on a suite of benchmark environments (e.g., DeepMind Control Suite, Procgen).
- Quantify the accuracy of epistemic uncertainty estimates by measuring correlation between model uncertainty and prediction error.
- Compare BNNs vs. ensembles for uncertainty estimation in terms of computational efficiency and robustness.
2. **Test Exploration in Sparse-Reward Environments**:
- Evaluate the method on tasks with sparse rewards (e.g., Montezuma’s Revenge, Ant Maze).
- Compare against baselines: random exploration, count-based methods, and curiosity-driven approaches.
- Measure sample efficiency (steps to solve the task) and exploration coverage (states visited).
3. **Scale to High-Dimensional Observations**:
- Test the method on pixel-based environments (e.g., Atari, Habitat).
- Ablate the contribution of the latent representation by comparing raw pixels vs. latent states for uncertainty estimation.
4. **Real-World Transfer**:
- Deploy the method on a robotic manipulation task with sparse rewards (e.g., door opening with a Franka arm).
- Evaluate robustness to sensory noise and partial observability.
5. **Ablation Studies**:
- Isolate the impact of uncertainty-aware rewards by disabling the aleatoric uncertainty masking.
- Study the effect of adaptive intrinsic reward weighting on long-term performance.
- Analyze the learned latent space to verify that it captures task-relevant features.

1. Title:
**Efficient Exploration in Reinforcement Learning via Intrinsic Reward Shaping with Contrastive Predictive Coding**
2. Problem Statement:
Reinforcement learning (RL) agents often struggle with efficient exploration in environments with sparse or delayed rewards. While intrinsic motivation methods, such as curiosity-driven exploration, have shown promise, they frequently suffer from two key limitations: (1) they fail to distinguish between truly novel states and stochastic noise, leading to inefficient exploration (Burda et al., 2018), and (2) they lack a principled way to generalize exploration strategies across tasks or environments (Pathak et al., 2017). Current state-of-the-art methods, such as Random Network Distillation (RND) and curiosity-based approaches, often require extensive tuning and can be computationally expensive, limiting their scalability to complex, high-dimensional domains.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the inefficiency of existing exploration methods stems from their inability to learn a structured representation of the environment’s dynamics. By leveraging contrastive predictive coding (CPC) (Oord et al., 2018), we can learn a latent space where novelty is measured not just by prediction error but by the predictability of future states given past context. Our central idea is that an agent equipped with a CPC-based intrinsic reward will better distinguish between stochastic noise and genuinely novel states, leading to more efficient exploration. We further hypothesize that this approach will generalize better across tasks by capturing task-agnostic dynamics.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a three-part framework to address these challenges:
(1) **Contrastive Predictive Coding for Exploration**: We will train a CPC model to predict future states in a latent space, using contrastive loss to maximize mutual information between past and future states. The intrinsic reward will be derived from the CPC loss, incentivizing the agent to explore states where the model’s predictions are uncertain. This replaces traditional prediction-error-based curiosity with a more robust measure of novelty.
(2) **Adaptive Reward Balancing**: To avoid overemphasis on exploration at the expense of task performance, we will dynamically balance intrinsic and extrinsic rewards using an adaptive weighting scheme inspired by meta-gradient methods (Zheng et al., 2021). This will allow the agent to shift focus from exploration to exploitation as it learns the task.
(3) **Generalization via Task-Agnostic Pretraining**: We will pretrain the CPC model on a diverse set of environments to learn a generalizable representation of dynamics. This pretrained model will then be fine-tuned for specific tasks, enabling efficient transfer of exploration strategies.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Validate CPC-Based Exploration on Synthetic Tasks**:
• Design a gridworld with stochastic noise and sparse rewards to test whether CPC can distinguish noise from novel states.
• Compare exploration efficiency (measured by steps to reward) against RND and curiosity-based methods.
2. **Benchmark on High-Dimensional Control Tasks**:
• Evaluate on Procgen (Cobbe et al., 2020) and Atari games, focusing on environments with sparse rewards (e.g., Montezuma’s Revenge).
• Measure sample efficiency and final performance relative to baselines like RND and ICM (Pathak et al., 2017).
3. **Test Adaptive Reward Balancing**:
• Ablate the adaptive weighting scheme to quantify its impact on task performance.
• Compare fixed vs. dynamic reward weighting across multiple tasks.
4. **Assess Generalization via Pretraining**:
• Pretrain CPC on a suite of procedurally generated environments (e.g., MiniHack; Samvelyan et al., 2021).
• Fine-tune on unseen tasks and measure zero-shot exploration performance.
5. **Scalability and Computational Efficiency**:
• Profile training time and memory usage compared to baselines.
• Conduct a scaling study to assess performance as environment complexity increases.

Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in domains like games and robotics, but its sample inefficiency remains a critical limitation. Model-free RL methods often require millions of interactions to learn effective policies, making them impractical for real-world applications where data collection is expensive or risky. While model-based RL (MBRL) can improve sample efficiency by learning a dynamics model, existing approaches struggle with compounding errors in long-horizon planning and fail to generalize across diverse tasks. Recent work has explored using pretrained world models or offline data to bootstrap learning, but these methods either rely on unrealistic assumptions (e.g., perfect simulators) or suffer from distributional shift when transferring to new tasks. There is a pressing need for RL algorithms that can leverage prior knowledge adaptively while maintaining robustness to environment variability.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the key to bridging the sample efficiency gap lies in dynamically integrating model-based priors with online exploration. Current MBRL methods either rigidly trust their learned models (leading to exploitation bias) or discard them entirely when they underperform (wasting prior knowledge). Instead, we propose that an RL agent should *adaptively* weight its reliance on model-based priors based on their local accuracy and uncertainty.
Our central idea is twofold:
(1) **Uncertainty-Aware Model Priors**: By quantifying epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty in the dynamics model, the agent can selectively use model-based rollouts in regions where the model is reliable, falling back to model-free exploration elsewhere.
(2) **Task-Driven Adaptation**: The agent should adjust its prior usage based on task-specific requirements (e.g., favoring model-based planning in sparse-reward settings while relying more on model-free updates in dense-reward scenarios).
We posit that this adaptive approach will outperform static MBRL and pure model-free methods, especially in settings with partial observability or non-stationary dynamics.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a framework called **Adaptive Prior RL (APRL)** with three key components:
(1) **Hybrid Dynamics Modeling**:
- Train an ensemble of probabilistic dynamics models (e.g., Gaussian neural networks) on offline data or early interactions, following the approach of Chua et al. (2018) in *PILCO*.
- Augment the model with a *local accuracy estimator*—a meta-network that predicts the model’s error for a given state-action pair, inspired by the *PE-TS* method (Rajeswaran et al., 2020).
(2) **Adaptive Planning-Exploitation Tradeoff**:
- Derive a *trust metric* combining model uncertainty and local accuracy predictions. Use this to dynamically blend model-based and model-free updates in the policy optimization loop, similar to *MoBoo* (Kidambi et al., 2020) but with online adaptation.
- Implement a scheduler that adjusts the planning horizon (e.g., using *Shorter Horizon Model-Based Optimization* from Lampe et al., 2023) based on the trust metric.
(3) **Task-Conditioned Policy Learning**:
- Extend the policy network to explicitly condition on task descriptors (e.g., reward function or goal space) and the current trust metric. This builds on *HyperPolicy* (Zhou et al., 2023) but integrates model-based uncertainty.
- Use meta-reinforcement learning to pre-train the policy on a distribution of tasks, enabling fast adaptation to new environments.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Validate Uncertainty Estimation**:
- Test the ensemble dynamics model and local accuracy estimator on benchmark tasks (MuJoCo, DeepMind Control Suite) with injected noise.
- Measure how well the trust metric correlates with actual model error across states.
2. **Compare Hybrid vs. Static MBRL**:
- Ablate APRL against pure model-free (SAC), model-based (MBPO), and hybrid (MoBoo) baselines on sparse-reward tasks (e.g., AntMaze).
- Metrics: Sample efficiency, asymptotic performance, and robustness to model mismatch.
3. **Evaluate Task Adaptation**:
- Train APRL on a suite of procedurally generated tasks (e.g., Procgen) and test zero-shot transfer.
- Compare to task-conditioned baselines like HyperPolicy and PEARL (Rakelly et al., 2019).
4. **Long-Horizon Planning Benchmark**:
- Test APRL on tasks requiring multi-step reasoning (e.g., Kitchen from D4RL) with varying planning horizons.
- Analyze how adaptive horizon scheduling affects performance.
5. **Real-World Robot Validation**:
- Deploy APRL on a robotic arm for object manipulation, comparing data efficiency to model-free PPO and model-based PETS.
- Measure success rates and wall-clock training time.

**Efficient Reinforcement Learning with Adaptive Model-Based Priors**
2. Problem Statement:
Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in domains like games and robotics, but its sample inefficiency remains a critical bottleneck, particularly in real-world applications where data collection is expensive or time-consuming. Model-free RL methods, while flexible, often require millions of interactions to converge, and model-based RL (MBRL) approaches struggle with compounding errors in long-horizon tasks. Current hybrid methods, such as Dyna-style algorithms or latent models, attempt to balance efficiency and robustness but often fail to generalize across diverse environments or scale to high-dimensional state spaces. There is a pressing need for RL algorithms that can leverage prior knowledge adaptively while maintaining sample efficiency and generalization.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the key limitation of existing MBRL methods lies in their rigid use of learned dynamics models, which do not adaptively weigh their uncertainty or relevance to the current task. Prior work has shown that incorporating probabilistic ensembles or meta-learning can improve robustness, but these approaches often lack mechanisms to dynamically prioritize or discard model predictions based on their empirical accuracy.
Our central idea is to develop an adaptive prior mechanism that dynamically adjusts the influence of a learned model based on its local accuracy and uncertainty. We believe that by integrating this with model-free policy updates, the algorithm can achieve the sample efficiency of MBRL while retaining the robustness of model-free methods. Specifically, we hypothesize that an adaptive prior can reduce the impact of model bias in states where the dynamics are poorly modeled, while still leveraging the model where it is reliable.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a novel framework, **Adaptive Prior RL (APRL)**, which combines three key innovations:
(1) **Uncertainty-Aware Model Priors**:
We will extend ensemble-based dynamics models to output not only predicted next states but also a confidence score based on ensemble disagreement. This score will be used to dynamically weight the model’s influence on the policy update. The weighting function will be learned end-to-end, allowing the agent to adaptively trust or distrust the model in different regions of the state space.
(2) **Hybrid Policy Optimization**:
We will integrate the adaptive prior with a model-free policy gradient method (e.g., PPO or SAC) by interpolating between model-based and model-free updates. The interpolation weights will be determined by the model’s confidence, ensuring that the policy relies more on the model in well-explored regions and falls back to model-free updates in uncertain states.
(3) **Task-Aware Meta-Learning**:
To generalize across tasks, we will meta-train the dynamics model and confidence estimator on a distribution of related environments. This will enable the model to quickly adapt its priors to new tasks, reducing the need for extensive exploration.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Validate Adaptive Priors in Toy Environments**:
- Design synthetic tasks where model bias is known to cause failures (e.g., non-stationary dynamics or sparse rewards).
- Compare APRL to baselines (MBRL, model-free, and hybrid methods) on sample efficiency and final performance.
2. **Benchmark on Continuous Control Tasks**:
- Test APRL on MuJoCo and PyBullet benchmarks (e.g., HalfCheetah, Ant) with varying levels of noise and partial observability.
- Measure sample complexity, robustness to model error, and asymptotic performance.
3. **Evaluate in High-Dimensional Settings**:
- Scale to pixel-based tasks (e.g., DeepMind Control Suite) to assess APRL’s ability to handle complex state representations.
- Ablate the importance of the confidence estimator by comparing to fixed-weight hybrids.
4. **Meta-Learning Generalization**:
- Train APRL on a suite of related tasks (e.g., robot manipulation with varying object dynamics).
- Evaluate zero-shot transfer to unseen tasks and compare to meta-RL baselines (e.g., PEARL).
5. **Real-World Feasibility Study**:
- Deploy APRL on a physical robot arm for a grasping task with limited data.
- Quantify the reduction in required interactions compared to pure model-free or model-based approaches.

**Efficient Exploration in Reinforcement Learning via Latent World Models with Uncertainty-Aware Planning**
2. Problem Statement:
Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms struggle with sample efficiency and exploration in high-dimensional or sparse-reward environments. While model-free RL methods like PPO and SAC have achieved impressive results, they often require millions of interactions, making them impractical for real-world applications. Model-based RL (MBRL) offers better sample efficiency by learning a dynamics model, but existing approaches suffer from compounding errors due to inaccurate long-horizon predictions. Additionally, exploration remains a challenge: traditional methods like epsilon-greedy or noise injection are inefficient in complex environments. There is a critical need for RL algorithms that combine the sample efficiency of MBRL with principled exploration strategies to tackle sparse-reward tasks.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the key to efficient exploration lies in leveraging learned world models to quantify epistemic uncertainty and guide exploration toward regions of high uncertainty. Prior work, such as PETS (Chua et al., 2018) and Dreamer (Hafner et al., 2020), demonstrates the potential of MBRL but does not explicitly address exploration bottlenecks. Recent advances in latent world models (e.g., PlaNet) suggest that encoding states into a compact latent space can improve generalization and long-horizon planning.
Our central idea is to integrate uncertainty-aware planning into latent world models. We propose that by (1) learning a probabilistic latent dynamics model that captures epistemic uncertainty and (2) using this uncertainty to drive exploration via optimistic planning, we can achieve more efficient exploration and better sample efficiency than existing MBRL or model-free methods.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a three-part framework:
(1) **Latent Probabilistic Dynamics Model**:
We will extend the Dreamer architecture by learning a latent dynamics model with explicit uncertainty quantification. The model will use a variational autoencoder (VAE) to compress high-dimensional observations into a latent space and a recurrent neural network (RNN) with probabilistic outputs to predict next-state distributions. Unlike deterministic models, this approach will capture both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty, enabling better long-horizon planning.
(2) **Uncertainty-Aware Planning**:
We will develop a planning algorithm that leverages the learned uncertainty estimates to guide exploration. Inspired by Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) methods, we will formulate an optimistic planning objective that biases actions toward regions of high epistemic uncertainty. This will be implemented via a modified Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) that prioritizes uncertain states during rollouts.
(3) **Hybrid Exploration Strategy**:
To balance exploration and exploitation, we will combine uncertainty-driven planning with a model-free policy. The model-free component will be trained on imagined trajectories from the world model, while the uncertainty-aware planner will periodically intervene to explore novel states. This hybrid approach aims to mitigate the limitations of purely model-based or model-free methods.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Validate Uncertainty Estimation**:
- Train the latent dynamics model on benchmark environments (e.g., MuJoCo, DeepMind Control Suite).
- Measure the correlation between model uncertainty and prediction error to verify that uncertainty estimates are meaningful.
2. **Benchmark Exploration Efficiency**:
- Compare our method against baselines (Dreamer, PPO, SAC) on sparse-reward tasks (e.g., AntMaze, FetchReach).
- Key metrics: sample efficiency, success rate, and exploration coverage (measured by state visitation entropy).
3. **Ablate Planning Components**:
- Test variants of the planning algorithm (e.g., MCTS vs. random shooting) to isolate the contribution of uncertainty-aware planning.
- Evaluate the impact of hybrid exploration by disabling the model-free component.
4. **Scale to Complex Environments**:
- Apply the method to high-dimensional tasks (e.g., Atari, robotic manipulation) to assess generalization.
- Investigate whether the latent model can transfer knowledge across related tasks.
5. **Real-World Feasibility**:
- Deploy the algorithm on a physical robot (e.g., UR5 arm) to test sample efficiency and robustness to real-world noise.
- Measure wall-clock time and interaction steps required to solve tasks like object stacking.

**Efficient Reinforcement Learning with Adaptive Model-Based Priors**
2. Problem Statement:
Model-free reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), have achieved remarkable success in various domains. However, they suffer from high sample inefficiency, requiring millions of environment interactions to learn effective policies. While model-based RL (MBRL) methods can improve sample efficiency by learning a dynamics model, they often struggle with compounding errors in long-horizon planning and fail to generalize across diverse tasks. Current hybrid approaches, such as MuZero, integrate model-free and model-based learning but are computationally expensive and lack adaptability to varying task complexities. There is a critical need for RL algorithms that dynamically balance model-based planning with model-free learning while maintaining computational efficiency.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the key limitation of existing MBRL methods is their fixed reliance on learned dynamics models, which may not be equally reliable across all states or tasks. Instead, we propose that RL agents should *adaptively* weigh the use of model-based priors based on the uncertainty of the dynamics model and the complexity of the task. Our central idea is to develop a framework where the agent dynamically switches between model-based planning and model-free learning, guided by a learned confidence metric. We believe this approach can achieve superior sample efficiency while mitigating the pitfalls of model-based methods, such as compounding errors.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a novel RL framework, **Adaptive Model-Based Priors (AMBP)**, which consists of three key components:
(1) **Uncertainty-Aware Dynamics Model**: We will train an ensemble of probabilistic dynamics models to estimate both the predicted next state and the epistemic uncertainty. The uncertainty metric will serve as a confidence signal for when to trust model-based predictions. This builds on prior work in uncertainty estimation for RL (Chua et al., 2018).
(2) **Adaptive Planning-Exploitation Trade-off**: We will introduce a gating mechanism that dynamically decides whether to use model-based rollouts or model-free policy updates. The gating function will be learned via meta-optimization, using task complexity and model uncertainty as inputs. This extends ideas from adaptive control (Nagabandi et al., 2020) to RL.
(3) **Efficient Hierarchical Learning**: To reduce computational overhead, we will hierarchically structure the planning process. Short-horizon rollouts will use the dynamics model for fine-grained adjustments, while long-horizon decisions will rely on model-free value estimates. This hierarchical approach is inspired by recent work in hierarchical RL (Nachum et al., 2019).
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Validate Uncertainty Estimation**:
- Train an ensemble of dynamics models on benchmark tasks (e.g., MuJoCo locomotion).

While model-based RL (MBRL) can improve sample efficiency by learning a dynamics model, these methods often struggle with compounding errors in long-horizon tasks and fail to generalize beyond their training distribution. Recent hybrid approaches, such as MuZero (Schrittwieser et al., 2020), combine model-free and model-based learning but still rely heavily on accurate dynamics models. There is a need for RL algorithms that can leverage adaptive, uncertainty-aware priors to guide exploration and reduce reliance on exact dynamics models.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the key limitation of current MBRL methods is their rigid reliance on learned dynamics models, which are prone to bias and error propagation. Instead, we propose that incorporating adaptive, probabilistic priors—derived from offline data or domain knowledge—can significantly improve sample efficiency and generalization. Our central idea is to develop a framework where the RL agent dynamically interpolates between model-based planning and model-free learning based on the uncertainty of its priors. This approach could mitigate compounding errors by falling back to model-free updates when the model is uncertain, while still leveraging the sample efficiency of MBRL when the model is reliable.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a novel RL framework, **Adaptive Prior-Guided RL (APRL)**, which integrates three key innovations:

We will develop a probabilistic dynamics model that quantifies epistemic uncertainty using Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) or ensemble methods (Chua et al., 2018). The model will be pretrained on offline data (if available) and fine-tuned online. The uncertainty estimates will guide the agent’s exploration-exploitation trade-off.
(2) **Adaptive Planning Horizon**:
Instead of fixed-length rollouts, APRL will dynamically adjust the planning horizon based on the model’s uncertainty. For states with low uncertainty, the agent will use long-horizon model-based planning; for high-uncertainty states, it will switch to short-horizon or model-free updates. This will be implemented via a gating mechanism inspired by Mixture-of-Experts architectures (Shazeer et al., 2017).
(3) **Hybrid Policy Optimization**:
We will combine model-based value estimation with model-free policy gradients to balance bias and variance. The policy will be trained using a weighted objective that interpolates between model-based and model-free targets, with weights determined by the model’s uncertainty.

**Efficient Exploration in Reinforcement Learning via Intrinsic Reward Shaping with Contrastive Predictive Coding**
2. Problem Statement:
Reinforcement learning (RL) agents often struggle with efficient exploration in environments with sparse or delayed rewards. While intrinsic motivation methods (e.g., curiosity-driven exploration) have shown promise, they suffer from two key limitations: (1) they rely on handcrafted heuristics (e.g., prediction error) that may not generalize across tasks, and (2) they fail to distinguish between *novel* and *relevant* states, leading to wasteful exploration. Current state-of-the-art methods like Random Network Distillation (RND) (Burda et al., 2019) and Exploration via Disagreement (Pathak et al., 2019) are computationally expensive and lack theoretical guarantees for optimal exploration.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the inefficiency of existing exploration methods stems from their inability to learn a structured representation of the state space that captures *task-relevant* novelty. Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC) (Oord et al., 2018) has demonstrated success in unsupervised representation learning by maximizing mutual information between states and their temporal context. We propose that CPC can be adapted to RL to intrinsically reward states that are both novel *and* predictive of future outcomes, thereby guiding exploration toward regions of the state space that are most likely to improve policy performance. Our central hypothesis is that an intrinsic reward derived from CPC’s predictive uncertainty will outperform existing exploration heuristics in sample efficiency and final task performance.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a three-part framework:
(1) **Contrastive Predictive Coding for Exploration (CPC-Explore):**
We will train a CPC model to predict future state embeddings given a history of past states. The intrinsic reward will be proportional to the model’s prediction error, but unlike RND, this error will be contextualized by the agent’s temporal understanding of the environment. The CPC model will use a transformer-based architecture to capture long-range dependencies, similar to recent work by Parisotto et al. (2020) on RL with memory.
(2) **Dynamic Reward Balancing:**
To avoid overfitting to the intrinsic reward, we will dynamically balance extrinsic and intrinsic rewards using an adaptive weighting scheme inspired by Grondman et al. (2012). The weight will be adjusted based on the agent’s empirical performance, ensuring that intrinsic rewards dominate early in training but fade as the agent converges to optimal behavior.
(3) **Theoretical Analysis of Exploration Guarantees:**
We will derive theoretical bounds on the exploration efficiency of CPC-Explore using tools from information theory (Cover & Thomas, 2006). Specifically, we aim to prove that CPC-Explore achieves near-optimal exploration in polynomial time for a class of MDPs with sparse rewards.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Benchmark Against Baselines:**
• Compare CPC-Explore to RND, Disagreement, and Noisy Networks (Fortunato et al., 2018) on sparse-reward tasks (e.g., Montezuma’s Revenge, Ant Maze).
• Metrics: Sample efficiency, final reward, and exploration coverage (measured by state visitation entropy).
2. **Ablation Studies:**
• Test variants of CPC-Explore: (a) without dynamic reward balancing, (b) with a simpler RNN-based CPC model.
• Evaluate the impact of the transformer architecture on long-horizon prediction.
3. **Generalization Across Tasks:**
• Train CPC-Explore on a suite of procedurally generated environments (Cobbe et al., 2020) to test its ability to generalize exploration strategies.
4. **Theoretical Validation:**
• Construct toy MDPs where optimal exploration is known and verify CPC-Explore’s performance matches theoretical predictions.
5. **Real-World Feasibility:**
• Deploy CPC-Explore on a robotic arm task with sparse rewards (e.g., block stacking) to assess computational overhead and real-time performance.

There is a pressing need for RL methods that can leverage learned dynamics models without being constrained by their inaccuracies or high computational costs.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the key limitation of existing MBRL methods lies in their static use of learned dynamics models—either fully trusting the model for planning or discarding it entirely when errors arise. Instead, we propose that RL agents should *adaptively* weigh model-based priors based on their local accuracy and uncertainty. Recent work in uncertainty-aware RL (e.g., PETS [1]) and meta-learning (e.g., PEARL [2]) suggests that dynamic model usage can improve robustness, but these approaches lack a principled mechanism to modulate model reliance during training and deployment.
Our central idea is to develop a framework where the agent learns to *interpolate* between model-free and model-based updates at the granularity of individual state-action pairs. By conditioning the trust in the model on its empirical error and epistemic uncertainty, we believe the agent can achieve faster convergence while avoiding catastrophic model exploitation.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a three-part approach to integrate adaptive model-based priors into RL:
(1) **Uncertainty-Calibrated Dynamics Models**:
We will extend probabilistic ensemble dynamics models (e.g., as in [1]) with a lightweight uncertainty quantification module. Instead of relying solely on ensemble disagreement, we will train an auxiliary neural network to predict model error directly from state-action features, enabling faster uncertainty estimation during deployment.
(2) **Adaptive Policy Optimization**:
We will modify policy optimization to dynamically blend model-free and model-based gradients. Inspired by gradient surgery in multi-task learning [3], we will compute a context-dependent weighting of updates, where the weight is a function of the model’s predicted uncertainty and the agent’s recent empirical returns. This will be implemented as a gating mechanism in the policy gradient update rule.
(3) **Efficient Planning with Selective Model Use**:
For planning-based agents, we will develop a hierarchical approach where short-horizon rollouts use the learned model, while long-horizon decisions fall back to model-free value estimates. The transition point will be determined by the model’s uncertainty threshold, learned via meta-optimization.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Validate Uncertainty Calibration**:
- Train ensemble dynamics models on benchmark tasks (MuJoCo, Atari) and measure correlation between predicted uncertainty and actual model error.

However, they suffer from high sample inefficiency, requiring millions of environment interactions to learn effective policies. While model-based RL (MBRL) methods can improve sample efficiency by learning a dynamics model, they often struggle with compounding errors in long-horizon tasks and fail to generalize well to unseen states. Current hybrid approaches, such as MuZero, combine model-free and model-based learning but are computationally expensive and lack mechanisms to adaptively weigh the importance of model-based priors during training. There is a critical need for an RL framework that dynamically balances model-based and model-free learning to achieve both sample efficiency and robustness.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the key limitation of existing MBRL methods lies in their static reliance on learned dynamics models, which can be inaccurate or misleading in novel states. Instead, we propose that an adaptive mechanism—one that dynamically adjusts the influence of model-based priors based on their local reliability—can significantly improve RL performance. Specifically, we posit that by quantifying the uncertainty of the dynamics model and using it to modulate the weight of model-based updates, the agent can avoid over-reliance on inaccurate predictions while still benefiting from the sample efficiency of MBRL.
Our central idea is to integrate a *learned uncertainty estimator* into the RL framework, which will guide the adaptive blending of model-based and model-free updates. This approach could bridge the gap between the sample efficiency of MBRL and the robustness of model-free RL, particularly in complex, long-horizon tasks.

The uncertainty will be estimated using techniques such as Bayesian neural networks or dropout-based variational inference, as explored by Gal & Ghahramani (2016). This will allow the agent to identify regions of the state space where the model is likely to be reliable.
(2) **Adaptive Policy Optimization**: We will develop a policy optimization algorithm that dynamically interpolates between model-based and model-free updates based on the uncertainty estimates. For states with low uncertainty, the agent will rely heavily on the dynamics model for planning (e.g., using model-predictive control). For high-uncertainty states, the agent will fall back to model-free updates (e.g., SAC or PPO). The interpolation weights will be learned end-to-end using a meta-optimization objective.
(3) **Efficient Planning with Uncertainty**: To mitigate the computational cost of planning with uncertain models, we will design a lightweight Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) variant that prioritizes exploration in high-uncertainty regions. This will be combined with a *selective imagination* mechanism, where the agent only uses model-based rollouts for states where the model is confident, reducing wasteful computation.

1. **Validate Uncertainty Estimation**:
- Train an ensemble dynamics model on benchmark RL tasks (e.g., MuJoCo locomotion).
- Measure the correlation between model uncertainty and prediction error across states.
- Compare uncertainty estimation methods (e.g., ensembles vs. Bayesian neural networks).

Instead, we propose that dynamically adjusting the influence of model-based priors based on their uncertainty can lead to more efficient and robust learning. Specifically, we hypothesize that:
- **Adaptive weighting** of model-based and model-free updates based on model confidence will reduce sample complexity while mitigating model bias.
- **Uncertainty-aware exploration** guided by model predictions will outperform purely model-free or rigid model-based approaches in sparse-reward environments.
- **Hierarchical priors** that combine short-term model predictions with long-term model-free value estimates will improve policy learning in complex tasks.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a novel framework, **Adaptive Model-Based Priors for RL (AMP-RL)**, which integrates model-based and model-free learning through three key innovations:
(1) **Uncertainty-Adaptive Weighting**: We will develop a mechanism to dynamically adjust the contribution of model-based and model-free updates during training. The weighting will be determined by the epistemic uncertainty of the dynamics model, estimated using Bayesian neural networks or ensemble methods (Chua et al., 2018).
(2) **Exploration with Model-Guided Priors**: We will design an exploration strategy that uses the learned model to propose high-reward trajectories while falling back to model-free exploration in regions of high model uncertainty. This builds on the idea of optimism in the face of uncertainty (Jiang et al., 2021) but adapts it to hybrid RL settings.
(3) **Hierarchical Policy Learning**: We will introduce a hierarchical policy architecture where a high-level model-based planner generates subgoals, and a low-level model-free actor-critic policy executes actions. The planner will be updated only when the model is confident, reducing reliance on inaccurate long-horizon predictions.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Validate Uncertainty-Adaptive Weighting**:
• Compare AMP-RL to vanilla MBRL (e.g., PETS) and model-free baselines (e.g., SAC) on benchmark tasks (MuJoCo, Atari).
• Measure sample efficiency and final performance, focusing on environments with varying levels of stochasticity.
2. **Test Exploration Efficiency**:
• Evaluate AMP-RL in sparse-reward settings (e.g., AntMaze, Montezuma’s Revenge) against exploration baselines like CURL and Plan2Explore.
• Quantify exploration coverage using state-visitation metrics.
3. **Assess Hierarchical Policy Learning**:
• Train AMP-RL on complex, long-horizon tasks (e.g., Kitchen, RoboSuite) and compare to hierarchical RL methods (HIRO, HAC).
• Analyze the frequency of high-level planner updates relative to model uncertainty.
4. **Scalability and Generalization**:
• Test AMP-RL on procedurally generated environments (Procgen) to evaluate generalization.
• Benchmark computational efficiency against hybrid methods like MuZero.
5. **Ablation Studies**:
• Disable uncertainty weighting to isolate its contribution.
• Replace the Bayesian model with a deterministic one to assess uncertainty estimation’s role.
• Vary the hierarchy depth to study its impact on long-horizon performance.

**Efficient Reinforcement Learning with Adaptive Model-Based Priors**
2. Problem Statement:
Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in domains like games and robotics, but its sample inefficiency remains a critical bottleneck, particularly in real-world applications where data collection is expensive or risky. Model-free RL methods often require millions of interactions to converge, while model-based RL (MBRL) can improve sample efficiency but suffers from compounding errors in learned dynamics models. Current hybrid approaches, such as Dyna-style algorithms or latent models, either fail to scale to high-dimensional state spaces or lack theoretical guarantees on policy improvement. There is a pressing need for RL methods that combine the sample efficiency of model-based learning with the asymptotic performance of model-free approaches while maintaining robustness to model inaccuracies.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the key limitation of existing MBRL methods lies in their static use of learned models—either fully trusted (leading to bias) or entirely ignored (wasting informative priors). Recent work (e.g., Janner et al., 2019; Yu et al., 2020) shows that adaptive weighting of model-based and model-free components can mitigate compounding errors, but these methods lack a principled mechanism to dynamically adjust trust in the model during training.
Our central idea is to introduce *adaptive model-based priors* (AMPs), where the RL agent learns to dynamically reweight its reliance on a learned model based on epistemic uncertainty and task-specific utility. We posit that:
1) Model uncertainty should guide exploration, with high-uncertainty states triggering more model-free updates.
2) The model’s utility should be task-dependent, e.g., prioritized for long-horizon value estimation but downweighted for short-term actions.
By formalizing this as a bilevel optimization problem—where the outer loop adjusts model trust and the inner loop optimizes the policy—we aim to bridge the sample efficiency gap while preserving robustness.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a three-part framework:
(1) **Uncertainty-Aware Model Learning**:
We will train an ensemble of probabilistic dynamics models (Chua et al., 2018) to estimate both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. The ensemble disagreement will serve as a signal for adaptive reweighting. To scale to high dimensions, we will explore latent-space models (Hafner et al., 2019) with variational inference.
(2) **Dynamic Trust Mechanism**:
The core innovation is a *trust network* that takes as input state-action pairs and their model uncertainties, outputting a scalar weight ∈ [0,1] for blending model-based and model-free targets. This network will be trained via meta-gradient descent (Zintgraf et al., 2020) to maximize policy improvement per sample.
(3) **Stabilized Policy Optimization**:
We will integrate AMPs into an actor-critic framework, where the critic uses the reweighted model-based targets for TD learning while the actor is updated via proximal policy optimization (Schulman et al., 2017) to avoid divergence. To mitigate overfitting, we will employ conservative Q-learning (Kumar et al., 2020) for value updates.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Validate Uncertainty Estimation**:
• Train ensemble models on MuJoCo tasks (Hopper, Walker) and measure correlation between ensemble disagreement and true prediction error.
• Test if uncertainty thresholds can trigger effective exploration in sparse-reward settings (e.g., AntMaze).
2. **Benchmark Adaptive Trust**:
• Compare AMPs against fixed hybrids (e.g., MBPO) on sample efficiency (episodes to 80% max reward) and asymptotic performance (final reward).
• Ablate the trust network to isolate its contribution vs. naive uncertainty-based heuristics.
3. **Scale to High-Dimensional Tasks**:
• Evaluate on RGB-based control (DeepMind Control Suite) using latent models.
• Measure wall-clock time vs. pure model-free (SAC) and model-based (PlaNet) baselines.
4. **Test Generalization**:
• Train on one set of robot dynamics (e.g., Cheetah mass parameters) and test on perturbed versions.
• Compare zero-shot transfer performance to domain-randomized baselines.
5. **Theoretical Analysis**:
• Derive bounds on policy suboptimality as a function of model error and trust weights.
• Analyze convergence guarantees under diminishing model trust (inspired by stochastic approximation theory).

**Efficient Reinforcement Learning with Adaptive Model-Based Priors**
2. Problem Statement:
Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in domains like game playing and robotics, but its sample inefficiency remains a critical limitation. Model-free RL methods often require millions of interactions to learn effective policies, while model-based RL (MBRL) can reduce sample complexity but struggles with model bias and scalability to high-dimensional environments. Current hybrid approaches, such as Dyna-style algorithms or latent dynamics models, attempt to balance these trade-offs but still face challenges in (1) maintaining robustness to model inaccuracies, (2) scaling to complex tasks, and (3) efficiently integrating prior knowledge. There is a need for a framework that dynamically adapts the reliance on model-based priors to maximize sample efficiency without sacrificing final performance.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the key to bridging the sample efficiency gap lies in *adaptive* model-based priors—mechanisms that dynamically adjust the influence of learned models based on their estimated accuracy and task relevance. Prior work (e.g., Nagabandi et al., 2018; Luo et al., 2019) has shown that model-based rollouts can accelerate learning, but their fixed usage often leads to suboptimal performance when models are inaccurate. We propose that by introducing a *learned gating mechanism* to weight model-based updates, the agent can selectively exploit model predictions only when they are reliable. This approach could combine the sample efficiency of MBRL with the asymptotic performance of model-free methods.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a three-part framework:
(1) **Adaptive Model-Value Integration**:
We will design a gating network that dynamically weights model-based and model-free value estimates. The gating mechanism will be trained using a meta-objective that minimizes the discrepancy between predicted and actual returns, similar to the *Model-Value Expansion* (MVE) approach (Feinberg et al., 2018). The key innovation is making the gating function context-dependent, allowing it to vary across states and actions.
(2) **Uncertainty-Aware Model Learning**:
To improve model reliability, we will integrate ensemble-based uncertainty quantification (Chua et al., 2018) with latent dynamics models (Hafner et al., 2019). The model will predict both next-state distributions and their epistemic uncertainty, which will inform the gating mechanism.
(3) **Efficient Prior Injection**:
We will explore how to inject domain-specific priors (e.g., physics rules or symmetry constraints) into the model-learning process. This will involve a modular architecture where priors are encoded as differentiable constraints, similar to *Physics-Informed Neural Networks* (Raissi et al., 2019), but adapted for RL.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Validate Adaptive Gating on Toy Domains**:
• Test the gating mechanism on grid-world and pendulum tasks, where ground-truth model accuracy is known.
• Compare against fixed-ratio hybrids (e.g., 50% model-free, 50% model-based) to quantify performance gains.
2. **Benchmark on High-Dimensional Control Tasks**:
• Evaluate on MuJoCo (e.g., Hopper, Walker) and DeepMind Control Suite.
• Measure sample efficiency (episodes to convergence) and final performance (average return).
3. **Test Robustness to Model Misspecification**:
• Introduce deliberate model biases (e.g., wrong friction coefficients) and assess whether the gating mechanism reduces degradation.
4. **Scale to Partially Observable Settings**:
• Extend the framework to POMDPs (e.g., visual navigation) using recurrent architectures.
5. **Real-World Feasibility Study**:
• Deploy on a physical robot arm for a grasping task, comparing data requirements against pure model-free baselines.

Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in domains like games and robotics, but its sample inefficiency remains a critical bottleneck, particularly in real-world applications where data collection is expensive or risky. Model-free RL methods, while flexible, often require millions of interactions to converge, and model-based RL (MBRL) approaches struggle with compounding errors in learned dynamics models. Recent hybrid methods, such as MuZero (Schrittwieser et al., 2020), combine model-free and model-based techniques but still face challenges in scalability and generalization. A key gap lies in the lack of adaptive mechanisms to dynamically balance exploration, exploitation, and model reliance based on task complexity and uncertainty.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the sample inefficiency of RL can be significantly improved by integrating *adaptive model-based priors*—learned dynamics models that dynamically adjust their influence on policy optimization based on epistemic uncertainty and task structure. Prior work (e.g., Nagabandi et al., 2018) has shown that model-based priors can accelerate learning, but these priors are typically static or manually tuned. We propose that a *hierarchical uncertainty-aware mechanism* can autonomously modulate the weight of model-based predictions during policy updates, reducing reliance on inaccurate models while leveraging them where they are reliable. Our central idea is that such adaptability will bridge the gap between sample efficiency and robustness, particularly in sparse-reward or long-horizon tasks.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a three-part framework:

We will develop a probabilistic dynamics model that estimates both aleatoric (data noise) and epistemic (model uncertainty) errors. Inspired by PETS (Chua et al., 2018), we will use ensemble neural networks to quantify uncertainty. The key innovation is a gating mechanism that scales the influence of model-based gradients in policy optimization proportionally to the model’s confidence.
(2) **Hierarchical Policy Decomposition**:
To handle long-horizon tasks, we will decompose the policy into a high-level planner (using the learned model) and a low-level actor (model-free). The planner will generate subgoals conditioned on uncertainty, while the actor will learn to achieve them via off-policy RL (e.g., SAC). This builds on HIRO (Nachum et al., 2018) but adds uncertainty-driven subgoal adjustment.
(3) **Efficient Exploration via Directed Curiosity**:
We will integrate a curiosity module (Pathak et al., 2017) that prioritizes exploration in state-space regions where the model’s epistemic uncertainty is high. Unlike traditional curiosity, our approach will *direct* exploration toward unresolved uncertainties in the dynamics model, avoiding redundant or unsafe exploration.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Validate Uncertainty Adaptation**:
- Synthetic tasks: Test on a gridworld with stochastic dynamics, measuring how quickly the gating mechanism reduces model reliance in high-uncertainty regions.
- Benchmark against MBPO (Janner et al., 2019) to quantify sample efficiency gains.
2. **Test Hierarchical Policy Scalability**:
- Long-horizon robotics tasks (e.g., Ant Maze, KitchenEnv) to evaluate subgoal adjustment.
- Compare success rates and wall-clock time to HIRO and model-free baselines.
3. **Evaluate Directed Curiosity**:
- Sparse-reward environments (e.g., Montezuma’s Revenge) to measure exploration efficiency.
- Track the ratio of novel states discovered per episode versus random exploration.
4. **Real-World Transfer**:
- Sim-to-real experiments on a robotic arm task, using domain randomization to test generalization.
- Measure task success with limited real-world data (≤100 episodes).

2. Problem Statement:
Model-free reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), have achieved remarkable success in various domains but suffer from high sample inefficiency due to their reliance on extensive trial-and-error interactions. While model-based RL (MBRL) methods can improve sample efficiency by learning a dynamics model, they often struggle with model bias and fail to generalize well to complex environments. Current hybrid approaches, such as MuZero and Dreamer, attempt to combine the strengths of model-free and model-based RL but introduce computational overhead and complexity. There is a critical need for an RL framework that leverages adaptive model-based priors to improve sample efficiency without sacrificing robustness or scalability.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the key limitation of existing MBRL methods lies in their static or rigid use of learned dynamics models, which do not adapt to the uncertainty or complexity of the environment. For instance, in environments with sparse rewards or non-stationary dynamics, a fixed model may lead to catastrophic errors in value estimation or policy updates.
Our central idea is to introduce **adaptive model-based priors** that dynamically adjust the influence of the learned model based on its estimated uncertainty and the task’s complexity. We believe that by selectively weighting model-based and model-free updates during training, the agent can achieve better sample efficiency while maintaining robustness to model inaccuracies.

4. Proposed Method:
We propose a three-part framework to integrate adaptive model-based priors into RL:

We will develop a probabilistic dynamics model that estimates both the mean and variance of state transitions. This model will use ensemble methods or Bayesian neural networks to quantify epistemic uncertainty, similar to PETS (Chua et al., 2018). The uncertainty estimates will guide the adaptive weighting of model-based rollouts.
(2) **Adaptive Prior Weighting Mechanism**:
We will design a gating mechanism that dynamically adjusts the contribution of model-based and model-free updates during policy optimization. Inspired by the successor representation (SR) framework (Dayan, 1993), this mechanism will prioritize model-free learning in high-uncertainty regions and model-based learning in low-uncertainty regions. The weighting will be conditioned on the dynamics model’s uncertainty and the agent’s current performance.
(3) **Efficient Hybrid Learning Architecture**:
We will integrate the above components into a unified architecture that combines the strengths of model-free policy optimization (e.g., SAC) with model-based planning (e.g., MCTS). The architecture will use parallelized rollouts for scalability and employ gradient-based planning to reduce computational overhead, similar to MuZero (Schrittwieser et al., 2020) but with adaptive priors.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:

2. Problem Statement:
Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in domains like games and robotics, but its sample inefficiency remains a critical bottleneck, especially in real-world applications where data collection is expensive or risky. Model-free RL methods often require millions of interactions to converge, while model-based RL (MBRL) can improve sample efficiency but suffers from compounding errors due to imperfect dynamics models. Current hybrid approaches, such as Dyna-style algorithms or latent-space MBRL, either fail to scale to complex environments or lack theoretical guarantees on bias-variance trade-offs. There is a pressing need for RL methods that dynamically balance exploration, model exploitation, and policy optimization while maintaining robustness to model inaccuracies.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the key limitation of existing MBRL methods is their static reliance on a single dynamics model, which either overfits to early exploration data or fails to adapt to changing uncertainty during training. Prior work (e.g., Janner et al., 2019; Luo et al., 2022) shows that model bias can catastrophically degrade policy performance, while rigid model-free components (e.g., SAC or PPO) waste samples on redundant exploration.
Our central idea is to introduce *adaptive model-based priors*—a mechanism that dynamically weights multiple dynamics models (e.g., ensemble members or Bayesian neural networks) based on their local accuracy and uncertainty. We posit that this approach can:
1) Reduce sample complexity by guiding exploration with temporally relevant model predictions,
2) Mitigate compounding errors by downweighting unreliable model rollouts, and
3) Enable seamless interpolation between model-free and model-based updates via uncertainty-aware gradient blending.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a three-part framework:
(1) **Uncertainty-Calibrated Model Ensembles**:
We will extend probabilistic ensemble dynamics models (PEDM) (Chua et al., 2018) with adaptive weighting. Each ensemble member will output a Gaussian distribution over next states, and their weights will be updated online via a meta-learner that minimizes *disagreement-based uncertainty* (measured by KL divergence across ensemble predictions). This replaces fixed ensemble averaging with context-dependent model selection.
(2) **Gradient Blending with Adaptive Trust Regions**:
Policy updates will combine model-free gradients (from real trajectories) and model-based gradients (from synthetic rollouts) using a dynamic trust coefficient *β*. Inspired by Schulman et al.’s (2015) clipped objectives, *β* will adaptively shrink when model rollouts diverge from real transitions (measured by Wasserstein distance). This ensures policy optimization favors reliable data sources.
(3) **Exploration via Directed Model Disagreement**:
We will derive an intrinsic reward signal from ensemble disagreement, but unlike prior work (Pathak et al., 2019), we will focus disagreement on *policy-relevant* state-action regions. This will be achieved by training an auxiliary classifier to predict which model disagreements correlate with future value estimation errors, prioritizing exploration where models disagree *and* the disagreement impacts policy returns.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Validate Adaptive Priors in Toy Environments**:
- Design a gridworld with *non-stationary* dynamics (e.g., shifting wind directions) to test if our method reweights models faster than static ensembles.
- Compare to MBPO (Janner et al., 2019) and Dreamer (Hafner et al., 2020) on sample efficiency and final reward.
2. **Benchmark on MuJoCo Continuous Control**:
- Train on modified MuJoCo tasks (e.g., HalfCheetah with randomized mass/damping) to evaluate robustness to model bias.

There is a need for RL methods that can dynamically adapt their reliance on model-based priors to optimize both sample efficiency and asymptotic performance.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the key limitation of current MBRL methods is their static use of learned dynamics models, which either overfit to local data or fail to generalize across diverse states. Prior work (e.g., Janner et al., 2019; Schrittwieser et al., 2020) shows that model usage must be carefully tuned, but this tuning is typically heuristic. We propose that RL agents should *adaptively* weight their trust in model-based predictions based on epistemic uncertainty and task relevance. Our central idea is to introduce a *meta-learned gating mechanism* that dynamically switches between model-free and model-based updates, optimizing the bias-variance trade-off at each timestep.

4. Proposed Method:

A lightweight meta-network will learn to modulate the influence of model-based rollouts based on uncertainty estimates and task-specific rewards. This gating mechanism will be trained end-to-end with the RL objective, using gradients from both model-free and model-based pathways. We will explore attention-based gating (similar to Parisotto et al., 2020) for long-horizon credit assignment.
(3) **Efficient Planning with Selective Rollouts**:
To reduce computational overhead, we will develop a *selective rollout* strategy that triggers model-based planning only in states where the gating network predicts high value-of-information.

Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in domains like game playing and robotics, but its sample inefficiency remains a critical limitation. Model-free RL methods, such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), often require millions of interactions to converge, making them impractical for real-world applications with costly or unsafe environments. While model-based RL (MBRL) methods, like Dreamer and MuZero, improve sample efficiency by learning dynamics models, they struggle with model bias and scalability to high-dimensional state spaces. Current hybrid approaches either fail to dynamically balance model-free and model-based learning or rely on rigid architectures that cannot adapt to varying task complexities. There is a pressing need for a framework that intelligently integrates model-based priors into RL while mitigating their limitations.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the key to bridging the sample efficiency gap lies in *adaptive* integration of model-based priors. Existing MBRL methods often use fixed model horizons or trust regions, which can lead to suboptimal performance when the learned model is inaccurate or the task requires long-horizon reasoning. We posit that an RL agent should dynamically adjust its reliance on model-based predictions based on (1) the local accuracy of the learned dynamics model and (2) the uncertainty of the current state-action space.
Our central idea is to develop a *hierarchical* RL framework where a meta-controller modulates the influence of model-based priors at each timestep. By leveraging uncertainty-aware model ensembles and attention-based gating, the agent can selectively "trust" its model or fall back to model-free exploration. This adaptive mechanism could enable faster convergence while maintaining robustness to model bias.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a three-part framework:
(1) **Uncertainty-Aware Model Learning**:
We will train an ensemble of probabilistic dynamics models (following Chua et al., 2018) to estimate both transition dynamics and epistemic uncertainty. Each model will output a Gaussian distribution over next states, and the ensemble disagreement will serve as a confidence metric. To scale to high dimensions, we will use latent space dynamics (as in DreamerV3) with a contrastive learning objective to improve state representation.
(2) **Adaptive Gating Mechanism**:
A lightweight transformer-based meta-controller will process the current state, model uncertainty, and task context (e.g., reward history) to compute a gating weight $\alpha \in [0,1]$. This weight will interpolate between model-based and model-free policy updates. The gating mechanism will be trained end-to-end with a multi-objective loss balancing sample efficiency and policy robustness.
(3) **Hierarchical Policy Optimization**:
The final policy will combine:
- A *model-based* branch: Plans using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) over the learned dynamics (similar to MuZero but with adaptive depth).
- A *model-free* branch: A standard actor-critic network for exploration.
The gating weight $\alpha$ will determine the blending ratio, enabling the agent to dynamically shift strategies.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Validate Uncertainty Estimation**:
- Train dynamics models on MuJoCo tasks (Hopper, Walker2D) and measure correlation between ensemble disagreement and model error.
- Test if the gating mechanism correctly downweights model usage in high-uncertainty regions.
2. **Benchmark Sample Efficiency**:

- Metrics: Episodes to convergence, asymptotic performance, and wall-clock time.

- Ablate components (e.g., remove gating) to isolate their contributions.

Model-free reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), have achieved remarkable success in various domains. However, they suffer from high sample inefficiency, requiring millions of interactions to learn effective policies. While model-based RL (MBRL) methods can improve sample efficiency by leveraging learned dynamics models, they often struggle with compounding errors and fail to generalize well to complex, high-dimensional environments. Current hybrid approaches that combine model-free and model-based RL either rely on rigid architectures or fail to adaptively balance the use of learned models and real experience. There is a critical need for a framework that dynamically leverages model-based priors while mitigating their limitations.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the key limitation of existing MBRL methods lies in their static reliance on learned models, which do not account for the varying reliability of model predictions across different state-action regions. Prior work (e.g., Nagabandi et al., 2018) has shown that model errors are often state-dependent, yet few methods adaptively modulate the influence of model-based rollouts based on uncertainty estimates.
Our central idea is to introduce an adaptive weighting mechanism that dynamically adjusts the trust in model-based rollouts based on localized uncertainty. We believe that by integrating uncertainty-aware model predictions with model-free policy updates, we can achieve superior sample efficiency while maintaining robustness to model inaccuracies. Specifically, we propose that a learned "trust gate" can selectively blend model-based and model-free updates, enabling the agent to exploit accurate model predictions while falling back to real experience when the model is unreliable.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a novel framework, **Adaptive Model-Based Priors (AMBP)**, which consists of three key components:
(1) **Uncertainty-Aware Dynamics Model**: We will train an ensemble of probabilistic neural networks (Chua et al., 2018) to predict environment dynamics. The ensemble disagreement will serve as a proxy for epistemic uncertainty, allowing the agent to identify regions where the model is likely accurate or unreliable.
(2) **Trust-Gated Policy Optimization**: We will design a gating mechanism that dynamically weights the contribution of model-based rollouts to the policy gradient updates. The gate will be conditioned on the model uncertainty, ensuring that high-uncertainty states rely more heavily on real experience. This gate will be trained end-to-end alongside the policy and value functions.
(3) **Stabilized Model Rollouts**: To mitigate compounding errors, we will employ short-horizon model rollouts (Janner et al., 2019) and use the trust gate to terminate rollouts early in high-uncertainty regions. Additionally, we will explore hybrid rollouts that blend real and imagined transitions to reduce bias.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Validate Uncertainty Estimation**:
- Train dynamics models on benchmark tasks (e.g., MuJoCo) and measure correlation between ensemble disagreement and actual prediction error.
- Ablate the number of ensemble members to determine the minimal effective size for reliable uncertainty estimation.
2. **Benchmark Sample Efficiency**:
- Compare AMBP against PPO, SAC, and state-of-the-art MBRL (e.g., Dreamer) on locomotion tasks (Hopper, Walker, Humanoid).
- Measure sample complexity required to achieve 80% of asymptotic performance.
3. **Test Adaptive Gating**:
- Disable the trust gate and compare fixed blending ratios (e.g., 50% model-based) to demonstrate the necessity of adaptive weighting.
- Visualize gate activations to confirm alignment with model uncertainty.
4. **Evaluate Generalization**:
- Train on modified MuJoCo environments (e.g., altered friction or mass) and test zero-shot transfer to unseen configurations.
- Compare to model-free baselines to assess robustness to dynamics shifts.
5. **Scale to High-Dimensional Tasks**:
- Apply AMBP to vision-based control (e.g., DeepMind Control Suite) to test scalability.

**Efficient Multi-Task Reinforcement Learning via Shared Latent Dynamics**
2. Problem Statement:
Current reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms struggle with sample inefficiency and poor generalization across tasks, particularly in complex, high-dimensional environments. While multi-task RL (MTRL) aims to address this by leveraging shared knowledge, existing approaches often fail to disentangle task-specific and task-agnostic dynamics, leading to suboptimal performance. For instance, methods like modular networks (Kirsch et al., 2018) or policy distillation (Rusu et al., 2016) either require explicit task identification or suffer from catastrophic interference. There is a critical need for a framework that can autonomously discover and exploit shared latent dynamics while preserving task-specific adaptability.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the key limitation of current MTRL methods lies in their inability to disentangle and leverage shared latent dynamics—underlying physical or causal structures common across tasks—without explicit supervision. For example, robotic manipulation tasks often share dynamics like friction or object mass but differ in goals (e.g., pushing vs. lifting). We propose that a model-based RL approach with a *latent dynamics bottleneck* can:
1) Automatically disentangle shared and task-specific dynamics via self-supervised learning,
2) Enable zero-shot generalization to unseen tasks by recombining learned dynamics, and
3) Improve sample efficiency by transferring knowledge across tasks.
Our hypothesis builds on recent work in latent world models (Hafner et al., 2023) but extends it to multi-task settings with a novel dynamics-sharing mechanism.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a three-part framework:
**(1) Latent Dynamics Disentanglement**:
- Design a variational autoencoder (VAE) with two latent spaces: *shared* (task-agnostic dynamics) and *task-specific* (goal-dependent features).
- Use contrastive learning (Oord et al., 2018) to enforce separation between these spaces, with a loss term minimizing mutual information.
**(2) Dynamics-Aware Policy Learning**:
- Train a model-based RL agent (e.g., DreamerV3, Hafner et al., 2023) that predicts rewards and transitions using the shared latent space.
- Introduce a *dynamics attention* mechanism to weight contributions from shared vs. task-specific latents during policy updates.
**(3) Zero-Shot Task Composition**:
- For unseen tasks, infer task-specific latents via few-shot adaptation (Finn et al., 2017) while freezing shared dynamics.
- Validate compositionality by combining learned dynamics (e.g., "push" + "red object" = new task).
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Synthetic Benchmarking**:
- Test disentanglement on grid-worlds with shared physics (e.g., wind, gravity) but varying rewards.
- Compare to baselines (e.g., PCGrad, Yu et al., 2020) on metrics like transfer accuracy and interference.
2. **Robotic Manipulation**:
- Train on MetaWorld (Yu et al., 2020) tasks (e.g., pick-place, push) with a simulated Franka arm.
- Measure sample efficiency (env steps vs. success rate) and zero-shot performance on unseen task combinations.
3. **Generalization to Unseen Dynamics**:
- Evaluate on Procgen (Cobbe et al., 2020) with procedurally generated levels.
- Ablate shared latents to quantify their contribution to generalization.
4. **Real-World Validation**:
- Deploy on a physical robot arm (e.g., UR5) for multi-object manipulation.
- Benchmark against modular RL (Kirsch et al., 2018) in terms of adaptation speed.
5. **Scalability Analysis**:
- Scale to 100+ tasks in MiniHack (Samvelyan et al., 2021) to test computational overhead.
- Profile memory usage and training time vs. monolithic RL baselines.

**Efficient Reinforcement Learning with Adaptive Model-Based Priors**
2. Problem Statement:
Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in domains like games and robotics, but its sample inefficiency remains a critical bottleneck, particularly in real-world applications where data collection is expensive or risky. Model-free RL methods often require millions of interactions to converge, while model-based RL (MBRL) can improve sample efficiency but suffers from compounding errors and brittle dynamics modeling. Current hybrid approaches, such as Dyna-style algorithms or latent dynamics models, struggle to balance the trade-off between computational overhead and generalization across diverse tasks. There is a pressing need for a framework that leverages the strengths of model-based priors without sacrificing the flexibility of model-free learning.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the key limitation of existing MBRL methods lies in their static use of dynamics models, which are either overly rigid (e.g., Gaussian processes) or prone to overfitting (e.g., deep neural networks). Recent work by Janner et al. (2019) demonstrated that model-based value expansion can accelerate policy learning, but their approach assumes a fixed model horizon. Meanwhile, Hafner et al. (2020) showed that latent models can improve exploration but require careful tuning.
Our central idea is to introduce *adaptive model-based priors* (AMPs), where the influence of the dynamics model is dynamically adjusted based on its local accuracy and the agent’s uncertainty. We posit that by selectively weighting model-based updates—downweighting unreliable predictions and emphasizing high-confidence regions—we can achieve faster convergence while mitigating compounding errors. This approach could bridge the gap between sample efficiency and robustness, particularly in sparse-reward or partially observable environments.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a three-part framework to integrate AMPs into RL:
(1) **Uncertainty-Aware Dynamics Modeling**:
We will develop a hybrid dynamics model combining ensemble neural networks (for global approximation) and Bayesian neural networks (for uncertainty quantification). The model will output both predicted next states and epistemic uncertainty estimates, similar to the approach of Chua et al. (2018) but with a focus on computational tractability.
(2) **Adaptive Horizon Control**:
Instead of a fixed planning horizon, we will dynamically adjust the model’s influence using a gating mechanism. Inspired by the work of Sekar et al. (2020), the gating function will depend on the model’s uncertainty and the agent’s current policy entropy. High uncertainty or policy divergence will trigger a fallback to model-free updates.
(3) **Policy Optimization with AMPs**:
We will integrate AMPs into proximal policy optimization (PPO) and soft actor-critic (SAC) frameworks. The key innovation is a modified objective function that interpolates between model-based and model-free gradients, weighted by the gating function. This builds on the gradient blending ideas of Buckman et al. (2018) but with a more principled uncertainty handling.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Validate Uncertainty Estimation**:
- Train the hybrid dynamics model on benchmark tasks (MuJoCo, Atari) and measure its calibration (e.g., expected calibration error).
- Compare against baselines (PETS, Dreamer) on prediction accuracy and uncertainty robustness.
2. **Test Adaptive Horizon Control**:
- Design a toy environment with non-stationary dynamics (e.g., changing friction coefficients).
- Measure how often the gating mechanism correctly switches between model-based and model-free modes.
3. **Benchmark Sample Efficiency**:
- Train AMP-enhanced PPO/SAC on sparse-reward tasks (e.g., AntMaze, OpenAI Gym’s FetchReach).
- Compare sample complexity and final performance against pure model-free (SAC) and model-based (MBPO) baselines.
4. **Evaluate Generalization**:
- Test transfer learning by pretraining on one MuJoCo task (e.g., Hopper) and fine-tuning on another (e.g., Walker2D).
- Measure zero-shot performance on out-of-distribution dynamics (e.g., modified gravity settings).
5. **Ablation Studies**:
- Disable the gating mechanism to isolate its contribution.
- Vary the ensemble size to study its impact on uncertainty estimation.
- Compare gradient blending strategies (e.g., hard vs. soft switching).

**Efficient Exploration in Reinforcement Learning via Intrinsic Reward Shaping with Contrastive Predictive Coding**
2. Problem Statement:
Reinforcement learning (RL) agents often struggle with efficient exploration in environments with sparse or delayed rewards. While intrinsic motivation methods (e.g., curiosity-driven exploration) have shown promise, they suffer from two key limitations: (1) they fail to distinguish between *novel* and *relevant* states, leading to wasteful exploration of irrelevant dynamics (e.g., noise or distractors), and (2) they lack a principled way to generalize exploration strategies across tasks or environments. Current approaches, such as random network distillation (RND) or curiosity-based methods (Burda et al., 2018), rely on handcrafted heuristics that may not scale to complex, high-dimensional domains.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the key to efficient exploration lies in learning a *task-aware* representation of state novelty that prioritizes exploration of states likely to lead to long-term reward. Drawing inspiration from contrastive learning (Oord et al., 2018), we propose that an agent can learn such representations by predicting future state transitions and using prediction error as an intrinsic reward signal. Our central hypothesis is that a contrastive predictive coding (CPC) framework can:
- Dynamically adapt exploration to focus on *relevant* novelty by contrasting states that are predictive of future rewards versus those that are not.
- Generalize exploration strategies across tasks by learning transferable state representations.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a three-part approach:
(1) **Contrastive Predictive Coding for Exploration (CPC-Explore):**
- Train a CPC model to predict future state embeddings conditioned on the current state and action. The intrinsic reward is derived from the contrastive loss, which measures how well the model distinguishes between "real" future states and negative samples.
- Unlike RND, CPC-Explore explicitly models temporal dependencies, allowing the agent to prioritize states that are novel *and* predictive of future rewards.
(2) **Task-Aware Intrinsic Reward Shaping:**
- Combine CPC-Explore with a task-specific reward signal using a dynamic weighting scheme. The weight is adjusted based on the agent’s uncertainty about the environment, favoring exploration in uncertain regions.
- This builds on prior work in meta-RL (Rakelly et al., 2019) but adapts the exploration strategy online without requiring task-specific fine-tuning.
(3) **Scalable Implementation:**
- To handle high-dimensional observations (e.g., pixels), we integrate CPC-Explore with an off-policy RL algorithm (e.g., SAC or DQN) and use a replay buffer to store negative samples for contrastive learning.
- We will optimize the computational overhead of CPC by using a lightweight transformer encoder for state prediction, inspired by recent work in efficient RL (Chen et al., 2021).
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Validate CPC-Explore on Sparse-Reward Benchmarks:**
- Test on Procgen (Cobbe et al., 2020) and Atari games with sparse rewards (e.g., Montezuma’s Revenge).
- Compare exploration efficiency (steps to reward) against RND and curiosity-based baselines.
2. **Ablate Task-Aware Reward Weighting:**
- Measure the impact of dynamic weighting vs. fixed weighting on exploration performance.
- Use a grid-world environment with controllable distractors to isolate the effect of relevance filtering.
3. **Test Generalization Across Tasks:**
- Train CPC-Explore on a suite of procedurally generated environments (e.g., MiniGrid).
- Evaluate zero-shot transfer to unseen tasks, measuring the reuse of exploration strategies.
4. **Scale to High-Dimensional Observations:**
- Train on pixel-based RL benchmarks (e.g., DeepMind Control Suite).
- Benchmark computational efficiency (frames/sec) against RND and other intrinsic reward methods.
5. **Analyze Learned Representations:**
- Use t-SNE to visualize state embeddings and quantify how well CPC-Explore clusters states by relevance.
- Correlate intrinsic reward magnitude with downstream task performance to validate our hypothesis.

**Efficient Exploration in Reinforcement Learning via Latent World Models with Uncertainty-Aware Intrinsic Rewards**
2. Problem Statement:
Reinforcement learning (RL) agents often struggle with efficient exploration, particularly in sparse-reward or high-dimensional environments. While intrinsic motivation methods (e.g., curiosity-driven exploration) have shown promise, they suffer from two key limitations: (1) *sample inefficiency* due to reliance on random exploration, and (2) *distraction* by stochastic or noisy dynamics, where agents overfit to irrelevant environmental noise instead of meaningful state transitions. Existing world model-based approaches (e.g., Dreamer) mitigate some of these issues but lack explicit uncertainty quantification, leading to suboptimal exploration-exploitation trade-offs. Closing this gap requires a principled integration of probabilistic world models with exploration-specific intrinsic rewards.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that combining *latent world models* with *uncertainty-aware intrinsic rewards* can enable more systematic exploration. Specifically:
- **Latent world models** (e.g., variational autoencoders) can compress high-dimensional observations into low-dimensional representations, reducing the exploration space.
- **Uncertainty quantification** (e.g., via Bayesian neural networks or ensemble methods) can identify regions of high epistemic uncertainty, guiding the agent to explore states where the model is least confident.
We posit that an intrinsic reward function combining *model uncertainty* and *prediction error* will outperform existing methods (e.g., random network distillation or count-based exploration) in both sample efficiency and final task performance.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a three-part framework:
(1) **Uncertainty-Aware Latent World Model**:
- Train a probabilistic world model (e.g., using variational inference) to predict next-state embeddings and rewards.
- Use *ensemble dynamics models* to estimate epistemic uncertainty, where disagreement among ensemble members signals unexplored states.
(2) **Hybrid Intrinsic Reward Design**:
- Combine *model uncertainty* (from the ensemble) with *prediction error* (discrepancy between predicted and actual next states) into a unified intrinsic reward:
\( r_{int} = \lambda_1 \cdot \text{Uncertainty}(s) + \lambda_2 \cdot \|f(s) - s'\| \).
- Dynamically adjust \(\lambda_1, \lambda_2\) via meta-learning to balance exploration and exploitation.
(3) **Efficient Policy Optimization**:
- Integrate the intrinsic reward with task rewards using *advantage-weighted actor-critic* (AWAC) to stabilize training.
- Deploy *planning in the latent space* (e.g., Model Predictive Control) to reduce interaction costs.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Validate Exploration Efficiency on Sparse-Reward Benchmarks**:

- Measure sample efficiency (steps to solve) and robustness to stochastic dynamics.
2. **Ablate Reward Components**:
- Disable uncertainty or prediction error terms to isolate their contributions.
- Compare with pure count-based methods (Bellemare et al., 2016).

Current hybrid approaches, such as Dyna-style algorithms or latent dynamics models, struggle to balance the trade-off between model complexity and generalization. There is a need for a framework that dynamically adapts the role of the model during training, prioritizing model-based updates when the model is accurate and reverting to model-free learning when the model is unreliable.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the key limitation of existing MBRL methods is their static reliance on the learned model, regardless of its local accuracy. This leads to suboptimal updates and inefficient exploration. Recent work (e.g., Janner et al., 2019; Sekar et al., 2020) has shown that model usage can be improved with uncertainty quantification, but these methods often introduce additional hyperparameters or computational costs.
Our central idea is to develop an *adaptive prior* mechanism that dynamically adjusts the influence of the model based on its predictive confidence. We posit that by integrating uncertainty-aware model-based updates with model-free policy optimization, we can achieve faster convergence while maintaining robustness to model errors. Specifically, we expect that:
- Adaptive model weighting will reduce harmful updates from inaccurate model rollouts.
- The policy will learn to leverage the model more effectively in states where the model is reliable, accelerating exploration.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a three-part framework:
(1) **Uncertainty-Calibrated Dynamics Model**:
We will train an ensemble of probabilistic neural networks (Chua et al., 2018) to estimate both the dynamics and their epistemic uncertainty. The model will use a Gaussian output distribution, with variance normalized across states to provide a consistent confidence metric.
(2) **Adaptive Prior Mechanism**:
The policy optimization objective will combine model-free and model-based terms, weighted by the model’s uncertainty. Inspired by Bayesian RL (Depeweg et al., 2016), we will derive a closed-form update rule that scales the model’s contribution inversely with its variance. This avoids the need for manual tuning of trust regions or mixing coefficients.
(3) **Efficient Rollout Strategy**:
To minimize computational overhead, we will implement a selective rollout mechanism. Short model-based trajectories will be generated only for states where the model uncertainty is below a learned threshold. This threshold will adapt during training using a meta-learning objective that maximizes the correlation between model accuracy and policy improvement.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Validate Uncertainty Calibration**:
- Train the dynamics ensemble on benchmark tasks (MuJoCo, Atari) and measure its calibration (e.g., via expected calibration error).
- Test whether the model’s uncertainty predicts rollout error on held-out transitions.
2. **Compare Adaptive vs. Fixed Hybrid Methods**:
- Benchmark against SAC+model (Haarnoja et al., 2018), MBPO (Janner et al., 2019), and Dreamer (Hafner et al., 2020).

There is a need for a framework that dynamically balances exploration, model exploitation, and sample efficiency without sacrificing robustness.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the key limitation of existing MBRL methods is their static reliance on a single dynamics model, which fails to adapt to the varying uncertainty and complexity of different state-action regions. Prior work (e.g., Janner et al., 2019; Luo et al., 2022) shows that model-based value expansion can accelerate learning but is sensitive to model inaccuracies. Meanwhile, ensemble methods (Chua et al., 2018) improve robustness but incur high computational costs.
Our central idea is to introduce **adaptive model-based priors (AMPs)**, which dynamically weight the influence of learned models based on their local uncertainty and task relevance. We posit that:

The gating policy will be trained via meta-reinforcement learning to minimize long-term regret.
(2) **Hierarchical Model Ensembles**:
To address compounding errors, we will train a hierarchy of models:
- A **global low-fidelity model** (e.g., linear approximation) for coarse exploration.
- A **local high-fidelity model** (e.g., neural ODE) for fine-grained control.
- A **latent transition model** (similar to Dreamer, Hafner et al., 2020) for abstract reasoning.
These models will be jointly optimized with a gradient-based alignment loss to ensure consistency.
(3) **Adaptive Policy Optimization**:
We will integrate AMPs into proximal policy optimization (PPO) and soft actor-critic (SAC) by:

- Penalizing policy updates that deviate from model-predicted value bounds.
- Employing a prioritized replay buffer to focus on high-uncertainty transitions.

**Efficient Exploration in Reinforcement Learning via Intrinsic Reward Shaping with Contrastive Predictive Coding**
2. Problem Statement:
Reinforcement learning (RL) agents often struggle with efficient exploration in environments with sparse or delayed rewards. While intrinsic motivation methods (e.g., curiosity-driven exploration) have shown promise, they suffer from two key limitations: (1) they often rely on simplistic dynamics models that fail to capture complex state transitions, leading to noisy or uninformative intrinsic rewards, and (2) they do not scale well to high-dimensional observation spaces, such as pixels in Atari or robotic vision tasks. Current state-of-the-art methods, such as Random Network Distillation (RND) and Curiosity-Driven Learning, either overfit to trivial dynamics or require computationally expensive auxiliary models. There is a need for a principled approach to intrinsic reward design that balances exploration efficiency with computational scalability.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the key to effective exploration lies in learning a structured representation of the environment’s dynamics that emphasizes *predictive uncertainty* in semantically meaningful state transitions. Prior work (e.g., Pathak et al., 2017; Burda et al., 2018) has shown that prediction error-based intrinsic rewards can drive exploration, but these methods often fail to distinguish between *novelty* (useful for exploration) and *noise* (irrelevant to the task).
Our central idea is to leverage **Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC)** (Oord et al., 2018) to learn a latent space where intrinsic rewards are derived from the predictability of future states. By contrasting positive (real) transitions against negative (synthetic) ones, CPC can provide a more robust measure of novelty. We further hypothesize that combining CPC with a lightweight uncertainty estimator (e.g., Bayesian neural networks or dropout-based uncertainty) will allow the agent to focus exploration on states where the dynamics model is uncertain but task-relevant.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a three-part framework:
(1) **Contrastive Dynamics Modeling**:
We will train a CPC-based dynamics model that maps state-action pairs to a latent space where future states are predictable via contrastive learning. The intrinsic reward will be proportional to the model’s inability to correctly classify real vs. synthetic transitions, ensuring that exploration is directed toward states with high *informational value*.
(2) **Uncertainty-Aware Reward Shaping**:
To avoid over-exploration in noisy or irrelevant states, we will augment the CPC model with uncertainty quantification. Specifically, we will use Monte Carlo dropout or ensemble methods to estimate epistemic uncertainty in the dynamics model. The final intrinsic reward will be a weighted combination of CPC-based prediction error and model uncertainty.
(3) **Scalable Integration with RL Algorithms**:
We will integrate our intrinsic reward module with both on-policy (PPO) and off-policy (SAC) RL algorithms. To ensure computational efficiency, we will employ techniques such as prioritized experience replay for intrinsic reward updates and parallelized contrastive training.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Validate CPC for Exploration in Toy Environments**:
- Test on grid-worlds with sparse rewards (e.g., Four Rooms) to verify that CPC-derived rewards outperform RND and curiosity-based methods.
- Measure exploration efficiency (e.g., coverage of state space) and sample complexity.

**Efficient Reinforcement Learning with Adaptive Model-Based Priors**
2. Problem Statement:
Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in domains like games and robotics, but its sample inefficiency remains a critical bottleneck, particularly in real-world applications where data collection is expensive or risky. Model-free RL methods, while flexible, often require millions of interactions to converge, and their performance can degrade sharply with sparse rewards or long horizons. Model-based RL (MBRL) offers better sample efficiency by leveraging learned dynamics models, but these methods struggle with compounding errors over long rollouts and often fail to outperform model-free baselines in complex environments. Current hybrid approaches (e.g., MuZero) mitigate some limitations but introduce computational overhead and require careful tuning. There is a pressing need for a framework that combines the sample efficiency of MBRL with the asymptotic performance of model-free methods while maintaining computational tractability.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the key limitation of existing MBRL methods lies in their static use of learned dynamics models. These models are typically trained to minimize prediction error uniformly across the state-action space, even though some regions may be well-explored (where model accuracy is high) while others remain uncertain (where model errors dominate). We posit that adaptively weighting the reliance on model-based priors—based on localized uncertainty estimates—can prevent catastrophic rollout errors while preserving the benefits of model-based planning.
Our central idea is to develop an **adaptive prior weighting mechanism** that dynamically adjusts the influence of model-based predictions during policy optimization. By quantifying epistemic uncertainty (e.g., via ensemble disagreement) and using it to modulate the trust in model-based rollouts, we can achieve more robust sample efficiency without sacrificing final performance. This approach could bridge the gap between MBRL and model-free RL, particularly in sparse-reward or high-dimensional tasks.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a three-part framework:
(1) **Uncertainty-Aware Dynamics Ensembles**:
We will train an ensemble of probabilistic dynamics models, where each member outputs a Gaussian distribution over next states. The ensemble’s disagreement will serve as a proxy for epistemic uncertainty. To scale to high-dimensional spaces, we will employ low-rank approximations for covariance matrices (similar to PETS [1]) and leverage spectral normalization for stability.
(2) **Adaptive Prior Weighting**:
During policy optimization, we will dynamically adjust the weight of model-based rollouts using a learned function of uncertainty. For states with low ensemble disagreement, the policy will rely heavily on model-based trajectories; for high-uncertainty states, it will fall back to model-free updates. This weighting will be trained end-to-end using a bi-level optimization objective, where the outer loop minimizes policy regret and the inner loop tunes the weighting function.
(3) **Efficient Hybrid Learning**:
To avoid the computational cost of full Monte Carlo tree search (as in MuZero [2]), we will integrate our adaptive priors into an off-policy actor-critic framework (e.g., SAC [3]). Model-based rollouts will be used only for short horizons (≤10 steps) in high-confidence regions, while model-free updates will dominate elsewhere. We will further accelerate training by reusing off-policy data for both model and policy learning.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:

1. Title:
**Efficient Reinforcement Learning with Adaptive Model-Based Priors**
2. Problem Statement:
Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in domains like games and robotics, but its sample inefficiency remains a critical bottleneck, particularly in real-world applications where data collection is expensive or time-consuming. Model-free RL methods, while flexible, often require millions of interactions to converge, and model-based RL (MBRL) approaches struggle with compounding errors in learned dynamics models. Recent hybrid approaches, such as MuZero (Schrittwieser et al., 2020), combine model-free and model-based learning but still face challenges in generalizing across diverse tasks or adapting to new environments without extensive retraining. There is a need for RL methods that can leverage prior knowledge more effectively while maintaining sample efficiency and robustness to model inaccuracies.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the key to improving RL sample efficiency lies in dynamically integrating adaptive model-based priors into the learning process. Current MBRL methods often rely on fixed or overly simplistic priors, limiting their ability to generalize or adapt to novel scenarios. By contrast, we propose that a learned, task-adaptive prior—conditioned on both the environment and the agent’s current policy—can significantly reduce the exploration burden and mitigate model bias.
Our central idea is to develop a framework where the agent learns not only a dynamics model but also a *prior distribution* over plausible dynamics, updated iteratively based on observed transitions. This prior can guide exploration and policy optimization, acting as a "safety net" against model inaccuracies. We further hypothesize that this approach will outperform existing hybrid methods in terms of sample efficiency and generalization, particularly in sparse-reward or high-dimensional environments.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a three-part framework for adaptive model-based priors in RL:
(1) **Learned Dynamics Prior**: We will design a probabilistic dynamics model that outputs both a mean prediction and a uncertainty-aware prior distribution over next states. This prior will be conditioned on the current state-action pair and the agent’s recent experience, enabling it to adapt to local environment dynamics. The prior will be trained via variational inference, similar to PETS (Chua et al., 2018), but with added flexibility to incorporate task-specific structure.
(2) **Adaptive Exploration with Priors**: To leverage the prior for exploration, we will derive an uncertainty-aware policy optimization objective that balances exploitation (using the mean dynamics prediction) with exploration (guided by the prior’s uncertainty). This builds on ideas from Bayesian RL (Ghavamzadeh et al., 2015) but extends them to handle learned, non-stationary priors.
(3) **Policy Transfer via Priors**: A key innovation will be enabling cross-task transfer by reusing the learned prior distribution. We will investigate how priors trained on one task can be fine-tuned or composed to accelerate learning in new tasks, reducing the need for exhaustive retraining. This will involve meta-learning techniques similar to PEARL (Rakelly et al., 2019) but applied to the dynamics prior rather than the policy.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Validate the Dynamics Prior**:
- Synthetic Tasks: Test the prior’s ability to capture uncertainty and adapt to local dynamics in toy environments (e.g., noisy pendulum, non-stationary cartpole).
- Comparison: Benchmark against fixed Gaussian priors (PETS) and ensemble methods (MBPO) on standard MuJoCo tasks.
2. **Evaluate Sample Efficiency**:
- Sparse-Reward Benchmarks: Measure sample efficiency on tasks with sparse rewards (e.g., AntMaze, OpenAI Gym’s sparse HalfCheetah).
- Metrics: Compare episodes to convergence and final performance against SAC (Haarnoja et al., 2018) and Dreamer (Hafner et al., 2020).
3. **Test Generalization**:
- Transfer Learning: Train the prior on one MuJoCo task (e.g., Hopper) and fine-tune on another (e.g., Walker2d), measuring the reduction in required interactions.
- Out-of-Distribution Robustness: Perturb physical parameters (e.g., friction, mass) and evaluate the prior’s ability to adapt without policy degradation.
4. **Ablation Studies**:
- Prior Components: Isolate the contribution of the adaptive prior by ablating its uncertainty estimation or conditioning mechanism.
- Exploration Strategies: Compare our uncertainty-guided exploration to random noise or optimism-based methods.
5. **Real-World Feasibility**:
- Sim-to-Real: Test the framework on a robotic arm task in simulation, then transfer to a physical system with minimal fine-tuning.
- Compute Overhead: Measure the additional computational cost of maintaining and updating the prior versus standard MBRL.

2. Problem Statement:
Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in domains like games and robotics, but its sample inefficiency remains a critical bottleneck, particularly in real-world applications where data collection is expensive or risky. Model-free RL methods often require millions of interactions to converge, while model-based RL (MBRL) can improve sample efficiency but suffers from compounding errors in learned dynamics models. Current hybrid approaches, such as Dyna-style algorithms or probabilistic ensembles, mitigate some limitations but still struggle with long-horizon tasks or environments with sparse rewards. There is a need for a framework that dynamically balances model-free and model-based learning while adapting to the reliability of learned models.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the key to bridging the sample efficiency gap lies in *adaptive trust*—dynamically adjusting the reliance on model-based priors based on their local accuracy. Prior work (e.g., Janner et al., 2019; Yu et al., 2020) shows that fixed trade-offs between model-free and model-based updates lead to suboptimal performance when the model’s error distribution is non-stationary. Our central idea is to introduce a *meta-learned gating mechanism* that evaluates the reliability of model-based predictions in real-time and selectively incorporates them into policy updates. We posit that this adaptive approach will outperform static hybrids by reducing compounding errors while retaining the sample efficiency benefits of MBRL.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a three-part framework:
(1) **Uncertainty-Aware Dynamics Modeling**:
We will train an ensemble of probabilistic neural networks (PNNs) to estimate dynamics and their epistemic uncertainty (Chua et al., 2018). The ensemble’s disagreement will serve as a proxy for model confidence, enabling the gating mechanism to identify regions of high uncertainty where model-free updates should dominate.
(2) **Meta-Learned Adaptive Gating**:
A lightweight meta-network will learn to weight model-based and model-free updates based on the PNN ensemble’s uncertainty, recent policy performance, and task horizon. This network will be trained end-to-end with the policy using a bi-level optimization objective (Finn et al., 2017), ensuring the gating strategy adapts to the environment’s complexity.
(3) **Stabilized Long-Horizon Rollouts**:
To mitigate compounding errors in long-horizon planning, we will integrate *shortened model rollouts* with periodic model-free corrections. Inspired by STEVE (Buckman et al., 2018), we will dynamically adjust rollout lengths using the gating mechanism’s confidence scores, blending imagination and real experience.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Validate Adaptive Gating on Toy Environments**:
- Design synthetic tasks with non-stationary dynamics (e.g., sudden friction changes in a pendulum swing-up).
- Compare our gating mechanism against fixed-ratio hybrids (e.g., MBPO; Janner et al., 2019) on sample efficiency and final performance.
2. **Benchmark on Continuous Control**:
- Test on MuJoCo tasks (Hopper, Walker) with sparse reward variants.
- Measure sample efficiency (steps to 80% max reward) and robustness to model bias.
3. **Evaluate on Long-Horizon Tasks**:
- Deploy in AntMaze and Kitchen environments (Nachum et al., 2019), where compounding errors are severe.
- Ablate the contribution of shortened rollouts vs. model-free corrections.
4. **Scalability to High-Dimensional Spaces**:
- Train on RGB-based tasks (e.g., DeepMind Control Suite; Tassa et al., 2020) to test generalization to pixel observations.
- Compare against Dreamer (Hafner et al., 2020) in terms of wall-clock time and GPU memory usage.
5. **Real-World Robot Validation**:
- Collaborate with a robotics lab to test on a manipulator with variable payloads.
- Quantify data reduction vs. pure model-free baselines (SAC; Haarnoja et al., 2018).

1. Title:
**Efficient Reinforcement Learning with Adaptive Model-Based Priors**
2. Problem Statement:
Model-free reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), have achieved remarkable success in various domains. However, they suffer from high sample inefficiency, often requiring millions of environment interactions to learn effective policies. While model-based RL (MBRL) methods can improve sample efficiency by learning a dynamics model, they are prone to compounding errors and struggle with long-horizon tasks. Current hybrid approaches that combine model-free and model-based RL either fail to fully leverage the benefits of both paradigms or introduce significant computational overhead. There is a critical need for a framework that dynamically balances model-based planning with model-free learning while maintaining computational tractability.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the key limitation of existing hybrid RL methods is their static reliance on either model-free or model-based components, regardless of the task's uncertainty or complexity. For instance, tasks with sparse rewards or long horizons may benefit more from model-based planning, while tasks with dense rewards may favor direct model-free learning.
Our central idea is to introduce an **adaptive prior mechanism** that dynamically adjusts the influence of model-based and model-free components based on the current state's uncertainty and the task's horizon. We believe that by learning to selectively trust the model-based prior or the model-free policy, the agent can achieve better sample efficiency and generalization while avoiding the pitfalls of compounding errors.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a novel framework, **Adaptive Prior RL (APRL)**, which integrates three key innovations:
(1) **Uncertainty-Aware Model-Based Prior**:
We will develop a probabilistic dynamics model that estimates both the next state and its epistemic uncertainty. This uncertainty will guide the agent's reliance on the model-based prior. Inspired by [1], we will use Bayesian neural networks to capture model uncertainty, enabling the agent to fall back to model-free learning in high-uncertainty states.
(2) **Dynamic Weighting Mechanism**:
We will introduce a gating network that learns to dynamically weight the model-based and model-free components. The gating network will take as input the state, the model's uncertainty, and the task horizon (estimated via temporal difference learning). This builds on the adaptive control literature [2] but extends it to RL settings.
(3) **Efficient Planning with Learned Priors**:
To mitigate computational overhead, we will integrate the model-based prior into the policy optimization loop via a modified Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm. Instead of full rollouts, we will use short-horizon planning with the learned prior, similar to [3], but with adaptive depth based on the gating network's output.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Validate the Uncertainty-Aware Prior**:
- Train the probabilistic dynamics model on benchmark tasks (e.g., MuJoCo, Atari) and measure its calibration and uncertainty estimation.
- Compare its performance to deterministic models and ensemble-based approaches [4].
2. **Test the Dynamic Weighting Mechanism**:
- Ablate the gating network to study its impact on sample efficiency.
- Compare fixed vs. adaptive weighting schemes on tasks with varying reward sparsity (e.g., sparse-reward Hopper vs. dense-reward HalfCheetah).
3. **Benchmark Against Hybrid Baselines**:
- Compare APRL to state-of-the-art hybrid methods (e.g., DreamerV3 [5], MuZero [6]) on long-horizon tasks (e.g., AntMaze, Montezuma’s Revenge).
- Measure sample efficiency, final performance, and computational cost.
4. **Scalability to High-Dimensional Spaces**:
- Evaluate APRL on vision-based tasks (e.g., DeepMind Control Suite) to test its ability to handle high-dimensional observations.
- Study the trade-off between model complexity and planning efficiency.
5. **Real-World Feasibility**:

Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in domains like games and robotics, but its sample inefficiency remains a critical bottleneck, particularly in real-world applications where data collection is expensive or risky. Model-free RL methods, while flexible, often require millions of interactions to converge, and their exploration strategies can be inefficient in sparse-reward environments. Model-based RL (MBRL) offers better sample efficiency by leveraging learned dynamics models, but these methods struggle with compounding errors in long-horizon tasks and often fail to generalize beyond their training distributions. Recent hybrid approaches (e.g., MuZero) combine model-free and model-based techniques but still face computational overhead and instability in complex environments. There is a pressing need for RL algorithms that can adaptively balance exploration, exploitation, and model uncertainty while maintaining computational tractability.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the key to bridging the sample efficiency gap lies in **adaptive model-based priors**—dynamically weighting the influence of learned models based on their uncertainty and task relevance. Current MBRL methods either rigidly trust their models (leading to compounding errors) or discard them entirely when they fail (wasting valuable prior knowledge). We propose that an RL agent can achieve superior performance by:
- **Contextual Model Trust**: Adjusting the reliance on learned models based on their local accuracy and the agent’s uncertainty in specific state-action regions.
- **Hierarchical Priors**: Combining coarse, generalizable priors (e.g., physics-inspired models) with fine-grained learned dynamics to mitigate model bias.
- **Directed Exploration**: Using model uncertainty to guide exploration toward regions where the agent’s knowledge is most incomplete.
We predict that such an adaptive approach will outperform both pure model-free and rigid model-based methods in sample efficiency and asymptotic performance, especially in sparse-reward and long-horizon tasks.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a three-part framework, **Adaptive Prior RL (APRL)**:
(1) **Uncertainty-Aware Model Weighting**:
- Extend probabilistic ensemble dynamics models (Chua et al., 2018) with a context-aware gating mechanism. The gating function will dynamically interpolate between model-free and model-based updates based on the ensemble’s disagreement (uncertainty) and the agent’s empirical error in recent transitions.
- Implement a meta-learner to predict the optimal weighting for each state-action pair, trained via reinforcement learning on an auxiliary "trust" reward signal.
(2) **Hierarchical Priors for Generalization**:
- Integrate coarse priors (e.g., Lagrangian mechanics for robotics) as a fallback when learned models are uncertain. These priors will be encoded as differentiable constraints in the dynamics model, similar to prior work on physics-informed RL (Sanchez-Gonzalez et al., 2020).
- Use attention mechanisms to selectively combine priors at different levels of abstraction, enabling the agent to blend domain knowledge with data-driven learning.
(3) **Uncertainty-Driven Exploration**:
- Develop a novel exploration bonus derived from the epistemic uncertainty of the ensemble dynamics model, scaled by the adaptive weighting from (1). This will replace traditional count-based or entropy-based exploration in sparse-reward settings.
- Optimize the exploration bonus for computational efficiency using low-rank approximations of the ensemble’s covariance matrix, enabling scalable deployment in high-dimensional spaces.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Validate Adaptive Weighting on Toy Tasks**:
- Design gridworld and continuous control tasks with **deliberate model mismatch** (e.g., sudden dynamics shifts or partial observability).
- Compare APRL’s model weighting against fixed hybrids (e.g., Dyna) and model-free baselines (PPO, SAC) on metrics like sample efficiency and robustness to model error.
2. **Benchmark Hierarchical Priors in Robotics**:
- Test APRL on MuJoCo tasks (Walker, Cheetah) with **sparse rewards** and **perturbed dynamics** (e.g., added friction or mass changes).
- Ablate the contribution of physics priors by disabling them and measuring performance drop.
3. **Long-Horizon Task Evaluation**:
- Evaluate APRL on **Atari games with delayed rewards** (e.g., Montezuma’s Revenge) and **real-world robotics tasks** (e.g., door opening with a robotic arm).
- Measure the agent’s ability to **generalize** to unseen variants of the environment (e.g., new object configurations).
4. **Scalability and Computational Efficiency**:
- Profile APRL’s runtime against MuZero and DreamerV3 on large-scale environments (e.g., Procgen).
- Quantify the reduction in environment interactions needed to reach 80% of asymptotic performance.
5. **Ablation Studies**:
- Disable individual components (e.g., exploration bonus, hierarchical priors) to isolate their contributions.
- Analyze the learned weighting function to identify patterns in when the agent trusts its model versus empirical rewards.

There is a need for a framework that dynamically balances model-based planning with model-free learning while adapting to environmental uncertainty.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the sample inefficiency of RL stems from rigid separation between model-based and model-free components, leading to either over-reliance on inaccurate models or wasteful exploration. Prior work (e.g., Nagabandi et al., 2018) shows that model-based priors can accelerate learning, but these priors are typically static. We propose that *adaptive* model-based priors—continuously updated based on uncertainty estimates—can bridge this gap. Our central idea is to:
- Use uncertainty-aware dynamics models to guide exploration, prioritizing regions where the model is confident.
- Dynamically reweight model-based vs. model-free updates during training, reducing reliance on the model as its errors compound.
- Integrate this into a unified policy optimization framework, enabling seamless switching between sample-efficient planning and robust model-free learning.
4. Proposed Method:

(2) **Dynamic Reweighting Mechanism**: Inspired by gradient blending in meta-learning (Flennerhag et al., 2021), we will design a gating function that adjusts the contribution of model-based rollouts to policy updates. The gating will depend on the model’s uncertainty and the agent’s recent reward progress, ensuring model-free dominance in high-error regimes.
(3) **Policy Optimization with Adaptive Horizons**: We will combine proximal policy optimization (PPO) with variable-length model-based rollouts. The rollout horizon will adaptively shorten in uncertain states (to avoid compounding errors) and lengthen in predictable regions (to exploit planning).

There is a pressing need for RL methods that can leverage prior knowledge efficiently while minimizing reliance on exhaustive trial-and-error.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the key limitation of existing MBRL methods lies in their static use of model-based priors—either handcrafted or learned offline—which cannot adapt to the agent’s evolving uncertainty or task requirements. For instance, a fixed dynamics model may overfit to early exploration data or fail to capture critical state transitions in sparse-reward settings.
Our central idea is to introduce *adaptive model-based priors* (AMPs), where the agent dynamically adjusts its reliance on model-based predictions based on epistemic uncertainty and task relevance. We posit that this adaptability will enable:
- Faster convergence by focusing model-based updates on high-uncertainty regions.
- Robustness to model bias by selectively falling back to model-free learning when predictions are unreliable.
- Improved generalization by transferring learned priors across related tasks without retraining.
4. Proposed Method:

(3) **Task-Aware Transfer Learning**: To enable cross-task generalization, we will embed the dynamics model and gating function in a hierarchical latent space (Hafner et al., 2019), where higher-level latents capture task-invariant structure and lower-level latents adapt to task-specific variations.

**Efficient Reinforcement Learning with Adaptive Model-Based Priors**
2. Problem Statement:
Model-free reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), have achieved remarkable success in various domains. However, they suffer from high sample complexity due to their reliance on extensive trial-and-error interactions with the environment. While model-based RL (MBRL) methods can improve sample efficiency by learning a dynamics model, they often struggle with model bias and fail to generalize well to complex tasks. Existing hybrid approaches that combine model-free and model-based RL either lack adaptability or introduce significant computational overhead. There is a critical need for a framework that dynamically balances the use of learned models and direct experience to achieve both sample efficiency and asymptotic performance.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the key limitation of current MBRL methods is their static reliance on a single learned model, which may be inaccurate or overly simplistic for certain states or tasks. Prior work (e.g., Nagabandi et al., 2018; Chua et al., 2018) has shown that model errors can lead to catastrophic failures in policy learning. However, recent advances in uncertainty quantification (e.g., ensemble dynamics models) and meta-learning (e.g., Clavera et al., 2018) suggest that adaptive model usage could mitigate these issues.
Our central idea is to develop a framework where the RL agent dynamically adjusts its reliance on model-based priors based on the estimated uncertainty of the learned model. We propose that by selectively using model-based rollouts only in states where the model is confident, and falling back to model-free updates otherwise, we can achieve superior sample efficiency without sacrificing final performance.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose a three-part approach to integrate adaptive model-based priors into RL:
(1) **Uncertainty-Aware Dynamics Modeling**:
We will train an ensemble of probabilistic neural networks to predict environment dynamics, similar to PETS (Chua et al., 2018), but with a novel uncertainty quantification mechanism. Instead of relying solely on ensemble disagreement, we will incorporate epistemic (model) and aleatoric (environment) uncertainty estimates to guide the adaptive use of model-based rollouts.
(2) **Adaptive Policy Optimization**:
We will develop a hybrid policy optimization algorithm that dynamically interpolates between model-free and model-based updates. Inspired by MBPO (Janner et al., 2019), our method will use uncertainty thresholds to determine when to trust model-generated data. However, unlike MBPO, our approach will also leverage meta-learning to adaptively adjust these thresholds during training.
(3) **Efficient Exploration with Model Priors**:
We will integrate the uncertainty-aware model into the exploration strategy. In low-uncertainty regions, the agent will use model-based rollouts to guide exploration, while in high-uncertainty regions, it will rely on model-free exploration heuristics (e.g., maximum entropy). This adaptive exploration strategy aims to reduce wasteful interactions in poorly modeled states.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:

1. Title:
**Efficient Reinforcement Learning with Adaptive Model-Based Priors**
2. Problem Statement:
Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in domains like game playing and robotics, but its sample inefficiency remains a critical bottleneck, particularly in real-world applications where data collection is expensive or time-consuming. Model-free RL methods, while flexible, often require millions of interactions to converge, and model-based RL (MBRL) approaches struggle with compounding errors in learned dynamics models. Recent hybrid methods (e.g., MuZero) combine model-free and model-based techniques but still face challenges in balancing exploration, generalization, and computational efficiency. There is a need for RL algorithms that can leverage adaptive, uncertainty-aware priors to accelerate learning while maintaining robustness to model inaccuracies.
3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the key to improving RL sample efficiency lies in dynamically integrating learned model-based priors with model-free policy optimization, where the reliance on the model adapts based on its estimated uncertainty. Current methods either rigidly trust the model (leading to bias) or discard it entirely (wasting informative structure). For instance, Janner et al. (2019) showed that naive MBRL suffers from "model exploitation," while Wang et al. (2022) demonstrated that fixed trust-region approaches can limit adaptability.
Our central idea is to design an RL framework where:
- The agent learns a probabilistic dynamics model that quantifies epistemic uncertainty (e.g., via Bayesian neural networks or ensembles).
- The policy optimization process dynamically adjusts its reliance on the model based on this uncertainty, favoring model-free exploration in high-uncertainty states and model-based planning in well-understood regions.
- The prior itself is continuously refined through interaction, enabling progressive transfer of knowledge across tasks.
4. Proposed Method:
We propose **Adaptive Prior RL (APRL)**, a three-part framework:
(1) **Uncertainty-Aware Dynamics Learning**:
We will extend ensemble-based probabilistic models (e.g., PETS; Chua et al., 2018) with latent state representations to capture task-agnostic structure. The model will output both predicted next states and uncertainty estimates, using divergence metrics (e.g., KL divergence) to flag high-uncertainty regions.
(2) **Adaptive Policy Optimization**:
We will develop a hybrid policy gradient algorithm that interpolates between model-free and model-based updates. Inspired by MBPO (Janner et al., 2019), but instead of fixed rollouts, we will use uncertainty thresholds to dynamically adjust the horizon of model-based rollouts. High-uncertainty states will trigger shorter rollouts or default to model-free updates.
(3) **Meta-Learning for Prior Transfer**:
To generalize across tasks, we will incorporate meta-RL techniques (e.g., PEARL; Rakelly et al., 2019) to learn a shared prior over dynamics. This prior will be fine-tuned incrementally, allowing the agent to bootstrap knowledge from related tasks while avoiding catastrophic forgetting.
5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
1. **Validate Uncertainty Quantification**:
- Design toy environments (e.g., noisy pendulum) where ground-truth uncertainty is known.
- Benchmark our ensemble model against Gaussian processes (GP) and variational methods (e.g., V-RNN; Chung et al., 2015) on calibration metrics (e.g., expected calibration error).
2. **Compare Hybrid Strategies**:
- Test APRL against baselines (SAC, MBPO, Dreamer) on MuJoCo benchmarks (Hopper, Walker).
- Measure sample efficiency (episodes to convergence) and robustness to model bias (performance under perturbed dynamics).
3. **Scale to Complex Tasks**:
- Evaluate on high-dimensional tasks (e.g., MetaWorld multitasking; Yu et al., 2020).
- Ablate the meta-learning component to isolate its contribution to transfer.
4. **Real-World Feasibility**:
- Deploy on a robotic arm (simulated and real) for object manipulation.
- Quantify wall-clock time savings vs. pure model-free RL.
5. **Ablation Studies**:
- Vary uncertainty thresholds to analyze sensitivity.
- Compare latent vs. raw state representations for dynamics learning.
- Test alternative prior architectures (e.g., diffusion models vs. ensembles).
