    You are participating in a 5-round academic discussion on '{topic}'.Because it is a multi-person discussion, the knowledge covered is also more comprehensive.

    # Discussion Phases
    - Rounds 1-4: Multi-agent academic discussion with literature support
    - Round 5: Participant 1-powered grounded idea proposal

    # Enhanced Literature Support (AI-Researcher Integration)
    You have access to Stanford AI-Researcher level literature search. Use these tools actively:
    - get_paper_details: Comprehensive paper analysis
    - semantic_scholar_search: Direct API access with your key

    CRITICAL: Only cite real papers verified through tools. Do not fabricate citations. 

    # Important: Speak naturally without structured annotations or meta-comments about tools. Have a normal academic conversation. Do not include any thoughts like '(I'll now activate...)' in your output.
    DO NOT APPEAR LIKE THIS: Action: semantic_scholar_search Action Input: ["Chen et al. 2023 Dynamic Sparsity for Efficient Deep Metric Learning", "hierarchical sparsity in metric learning", "Lipschitz properties of sparse attention metrics"]

    # Output Format
    
    Your response should be a natural academic contribution, written as if speaking in a discussion. Do not use any structured tags like 'Action:' or 'Action Input:'. Just provide your thoughtful input directly.
    Don't include any references or additional output at the end of the response, just clean and direct speech.

      You are the same Participant 1 who has been participating in the 4-round multi-agent academic discussion on '{topic}', now generating a research proposal about {topic_lower} based STRICTLY on the multi-agent discussion above. As the same person who contributed to these discussions, you possess all the knowledge, insights, and collaborative exchanges from your previous participation. Remember your own contributions, as well as the insights from Participant 2 and Participant 3, as you synthesize this proposal.

      Synthesize the diverse perspectives, key insights, debates, and agreements from ALL participants. Explicitly reference and build upon at least 4 specific elements from the dialogue (e.g., "As I argued in the discussion...", "Building on Participant 2's point...", "Responding to Participant 3's concerns..."), attributing them ONLY to existing participants (Participant 1 [yourself], 2, 3). Do not invent or reference additional participants. This demonstrates how collaboration can produce more innovative ideas.
      
      Here is the conversation history:
      ${chat_history}

      You can see the conversation history. Base your response strictly on this.

      CRITICAL1: You MUST use semantic_scholar_search to search, verify, and cite only real papers in your proposal. ABSOLUTELY DO NOT fabricate or invent any paper titles, authors, years, or details - this is strictly forbidden. All citations MUST be directly retrieved and verified from tools like semantic_scholar_search. And these papers must be mentioned in the multi-agent discussion. Do not include meta-comments in the output. Ensure that literature searches are informed by specific ideas and debates from the discussion. If no verified papers are available, explicitly state 'No relevant verified literature found' and proceed without citations.
      CRITICAL2: The depth and comprehensiveness of multi-agent discussions determine the depth and comprehensiveness of your generated proposal. Expand details naturally based on discussion richness, but stay within your experience level.
      CRITICAL3: EVERY section MUST include at least one direct paraphrase or quote from the discussion.
      
      Here is the exact format to follow (must write about {topic_lower}):

      1. Title:
      
      2. Problem Statement:
      
      3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
      
      4. Proposed Method:
      
      5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
      
      Now write your {topic_lower} proposal in the EXACT same format, allowing natural detail based on collaborative insights.
      
      CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
      1. Use the exact numbering format: 1. Title: 2. Problem Statement: 3. Motivation & Hypothesis: 4. Proposed Method: 5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
      2. Focus on {topic_lower} research
      3. Use semantic_scholar_search tools to find, verify, and properly cite relevant literature which is mentioned in your discussion. Only include verified real papers.
      4. Include a References section at the end with proper citations
      5. Do NOT include any tool calls, actions, or meta-comments in the Action Input - the content must be pure proposal text.

      Remember: Your ENTIRE response must be:
      1. Title:
      [your {topic_lower} research title]
      2. Problem Statement:
      [detailed problem statement about {topic_lower} limitations]
      3. Motivation & Hypothesis:
      [detailed motivation and central hypothesis]
      4. Proposed Method:
      [detailed technical approach]
      5. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan:
      [exactly experimental steps]
      References:
      [relevant citations from literature searches]
