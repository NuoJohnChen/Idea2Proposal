    "Summary": "The proposal introduces Selective State Space Models (SSMs) with a selection mechanism to address the quadratic complexity of Transformers. The method involves making SSM parameters input-dependent, designing a hardware-aware parallel scan algorithm, and integrating this into a simplified architecture called Mamba. The experiment plan includes synthetic tasks, real-world data tests, language modeling, efficiency benchmarks, and ablation studies.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Clear problem statement and motivation.",
        "High intellectual depth with a novel approach to SSMs.",
        "Comprehensive experiment plan covering synthetic and real-world tasks.",
        "Detailed ablation studies to understand model components."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Feasibility concerns about the hardware-aware parallel scan algorithm.",
        "Scalability to very long sequences (up to one million tokens) is unproven.",
        "Lack of detail on how the selection mechanism will be implemented efficiently.",
        "Potential over-optimism in matching Transformer performance."
